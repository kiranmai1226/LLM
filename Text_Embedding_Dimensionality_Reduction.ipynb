He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s fault.\\n\\nThe Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and wellpublicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA grim mood has gripped the country,â\\x80\\x9d the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of Julyâ\\x80¦ It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t right, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t normalâ\\x80¦\\n\\nHe turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.\\n\\nHe froze, nose to nose with his own scaredlooking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHello?â\\x80\\x9d he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.\\n\\nFor a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming â\\x80\\x94 as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough â\\x80\\x94 from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister, â\\x80\\x9clistenâ\\x80¦ Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a very good time for meâ\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99m waiting for a telephone call, you seeâ\\x80¦ from the President ofâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat can be rearranged,â\\x80\\x9d said the portrait at once. The Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I really was rather hoping to speakâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,â\\x80\\x9d said the little man. â\\x80\\x9cKindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80¦ ohâ\\x80¦ very well,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister weakly. â\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see Fudge.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pinstriped cloak, a limegreen bowler hat in his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAhâ\\x80¦ Prime Minister,â\\x80\\x9d said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. â\\x80\\x9cGood to see you again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can I help you?â\\x80\\x9d he said, shaking Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDifficult to know where to begin,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a week, what a weekâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad a bad one too, have you?â\\x80\\x9d asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridgeâ\\x80¦ the Bones and Vance murdersâ\\x80¦ not to mention the ruckus in the West Countryâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x93erâ\\x80\\x93yourâ\\x80\\x93I mean to say, some of your people wereâ\\x80\\x93were involved in thoseâ\\x80\\x93those things, were they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. â\\x80\\x9cOf course they were,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cSurely youâ\\x80\\x99ve realized whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d hesitated the Prime Minister.\\n\\nIt was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.\\n\\nHe had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself\\n\\nNaturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfproclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the stilldumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot to worry,â\\x80\\x9d he had said, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s oddson youâ\\x80\\x99ll never see me again. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll only bother you if thereâ\\x80\\x99s something really serious going on our end, something thatâ\\x80\\x99s likely to affect the Mugglesâ\\x80\\x93the nonmagical population, I should say. Otherwise, itâ\\x80\\x99s live and let live. And I must say, youâ\\x80\\x99re taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99reâ\\x80\\x93youâ\\x80\\x99re not a hoax, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt had been his last, desperate hope.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge gently. â\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Iâ\\x80\\x99m not. Look.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he had turned the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s teacup into a gerbil.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, â\\x80\\x9cbut whyâ\\x80\\x93why has nobody told meâ\\x80\\x93?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Minister of Magic only reveals himâ\\x80\\x93or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. â\\x80\\x9cWe find it the best way to maintain secrecy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut then,â\\x80\\x9d bleated the Prime Minister, â\\x80\\x9cwhy hasnâ\\x80\\x99t a former Prime Minister warned meâ\\x80\\x93?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this, Fudge had actually laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStill chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?\\n\\nThe shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s arrival. To the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to pry it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.\\n\\nThen, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named â\\x80\\x9cSeriousâ\\x80\\x9d Black, something that sounded like â\\x80\\x9cHogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just come from Azkaban,â\\x80\\x9d Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. â\\x80\\x9cMiddle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flightâ\\x80¦ the dementors are in uproarâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x93he shudderedâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Blackâ\\x80\\x99s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin YouKnowWhoâ\\x80¦ But of course, you donâ\\x80\\x99t even know who YouKnowWho is!â\\x80\\x9d He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, â\\x80\\x9cWell, sit down, sit down, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better fill you inâ\\x80¦ Have a whiskeyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and drew up a chair.\\n\\nFudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s whiskeyfree hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you think thatâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. â\\x80\\x9cLord Volâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeWhoMustNotBeNamed!â\\x80\\x9d snarled Fudge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorryâ\\x80¦ You think that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is still alive, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Dumbledore says he is,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin, â\\x80\\x9cbut weâ\\x80\\x99ve never found him. If you ask me, heâ\\x80\\x99s not dangerous unless heâ\\x80\\x99s got support, so itâ\\x80\\x99s Black we ought to be worrying about. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we donâ\\x80\\x99t see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassedlooking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been â\\x80\\x9cinvolved,â\\x80\\x9d but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that YouKnowWhoâ\\x80\\x99s Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, and I almost forgot,â\\x80\\x9d Fudge had added. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that itâ\\x80\\x99s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if weâ\\x80\\x99re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x93whatâ\\x80\\x93dragons?â\\x80\\x9d spluttered the Prime Minister.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, three,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge. â\\x80\\x9cAnd a sphinx. Well, good day to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA mass breakout?â\\x80\\x9d repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo need to worry, no need to worry!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll have them rounded up in no timeâ\\x80\\x93just thought you ought to know!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd before the Prime Minister could shout, â\\x80\\x9cNow, wait just one moment!â\\x80\\x9d Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.\\n\\nWhatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The site, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow should I know whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on in theâ\\x80\\x93erâ\\x80\\x93Wizarding community?â\\x80\\x9d snapped the Prime Minister now. â\\x80\\x9cI have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment withoutâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have the same concerns,â\\x80\\x9d Fudge interrupted. â\\x80\\x9cThe Brockdale Bridge didnâ\\x80\\x99t wear out. That wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorleyâ\\x80\\x99s family would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be affected tonight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do youâ\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Iâ\\x80¦ What?â\\x80\\x9d blustered the Prime Minister.\\n\\nFudge took a great, deep breath and said, â\\x80\\x9cPrime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that heâ\\x80\\x99s back. HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBack? When you say â\\x80\\x98backâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80¦ heâ\\x80\\x99s alive? I meanâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nThe Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, alive,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge. â\\x80\\x9cThat isâ\\x80\\x93I donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x93is a man alive if he canâ\\x80\\x99t be killed? I donâ\\x80\\x99t really understand it, and Dumbledore wonâ\\x80\\x99t explain properlyâ\\x80\\x93but anyway, heâ\\x80\\x99s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, heâ\\x80\\x99s alive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear wellinformed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Serious Black withâ\\x80\\x93erâ\\x80\\x93HeWhoMustNotBeNamed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlack? Black?â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. â\\x80\\x9cSirius Black, you mean? Merlinâ\\x80\\x99s beard, no. Blackâ\\x80\\x99s dead. Turns out we wereâ\\x80\\x93erâ\\x80\\x93mistaken about Black. He was innocent after all. And he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in league with HeWhoMustNotBeNamed either. I mean,â\\x80\\x9d he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, â\\x80\\x9call the evidence pointedâ\\x80\\x93we had more than fifty eyewitnessesâ\\x80\\x93but anyway, as I say, heâ\\x80\\x99s dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s going to be an inquiry, actuallyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his chargeâ\\x80¦ Not yet, anywayâ\\x80¦\\n\\nWhile the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, â\\x80\\x9cBut Blacks bytheby now. The point is, weâ\\x80\\x99re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt war?â\\x80\\x9d repeated the Prime Minister nervously. â\\x80\\x9cSurely thatâ\\x80\\x99s a little bit of an overstatement?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeWhoMustNotBeNamed has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a limegreen blur. â\\x80\\x9cSince they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridgeâ\\x80\\x93he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him andâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood grief, so itâ\\x80\\x99s your fault those people were killed and Iâ\\x80\\x99m having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what else!â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister furiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy fault!â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, coloring up. â\\x80\\x9cAre you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe not,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, â\\x80\\x9cbut I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you really think I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t already making every effort?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Fudge heatedly. â\\x80\\x9cEvery Auror in the Ministry wasâ\\x80\\x93and isâ\\x80\\x93trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s fault after all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was no hurricane,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge miserably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me!â\\x80\\x9d barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. â\\x80\\x9cTrees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuriesâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was the Death Eaters,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge. â\\x80\\x9cHeWhoMustNotBeNamedâ\\x80\\x99s followers. Andâ\\x80¦ and we suspect giant involvement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. â\\x80\\x9cWhat involvement?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge grimaced. â\\x80\\x9cHe used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, weâ\\x80\\x99ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, weâ\\x80\\x99ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we canâ\\x80\\x99t find the giantâ\\x80\\x93itâ\\x80\\x99s been a disaster.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t say!â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister furiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge. â\\x80\\x9cWhat with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLosing who?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think HeWhoMustNotBeNamed may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch andâ\\x80\\x93and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that murder was in the newspapers,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. â\\x80\\x9cOur newspapers. Amelia Bonesâ\\x80¦ it just said she was a middleaged woman who lived alone. It was aâ\\x80\\x93a nasty killing, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Itâ\\x80\\x99s had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge sighed. â\\x80\\x9cWell, of course they are,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cKilled in a room that was locked from the inside, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear about that oneâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes I did!â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister. â\\x80\\x9cIt happened just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, â\\x80\\x98breakdown of law and order in the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s backyardâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd as if all that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, barely listening to the Prime Minister, â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and centerâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOnce upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,â\\x80\\x9d he said cautiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey did,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge wearily. â\\x80\\x9cBut not anymore. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve deserted the prison and joined HeWhoMustNotBeNamed. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t pretend that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a blow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, â\\x80\\x9cdidnâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me theyâ\\x80\\x99re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right. And theyâ\\x80\\x99re breeding. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99s causing all this mist.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister sank, weakkneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow see here, Fudgeâ\\x80\\x93youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to do something! Itâ\\x80\\x99s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Prime Minister, you canâ\\x80\\x99t honestly think Iâ\\x80\\x99m still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunkenlooking man sitting opposite him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m very sorry,â\\x80\\x9d he said finally. â\\x80\\x9cIf thereâ\\x80\\x99s anything I can do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought heâ\\x80\\x99d be here by now, but of course, heâ\\x80\\x99s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s eye, the portrait said, â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll be here in a moment, heâ\\x80\\x99s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish him luck,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he wonâ\\x80\\x99t budge. If heâ\\x80\\x99d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still beâ\\x80¦ Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, fine,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.\\n\\nFudge got to his feet and, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.\\n\\nThe Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wirerimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you do?â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.\\n\\nScrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFudge told you everything?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cErâ\\x80\\x93yes,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister. â\\x80\\x9cAnd if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind, Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather that door remained unlocked.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather not be interrupted,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour shortly, â\\x80\\x9cor watched,â\\x80\\x9d he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. â\\x80\\x9cRight, well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a busy man, so letâ\\x80\\x99s get down lo business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, â\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly happy with the security Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already got, thank you veryâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, weâ\\x80\\x99re not,â\\x80\\x9d Scrimgeour cut in. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer officeâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if thatâ\\x80\\x99s what youâ\\x80\\x99re suggesting!â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister hotly. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of themâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s because heâ\\x80\\x99s a wizard,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. â\\x80\\x9cA highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, wait a moment!â\\x80\\x9d declared the Prime Minister. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t just put your people into my office, I decide who works for meâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour coldly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI amâ\\x80\\x93thatâ\\x80\\x99s to say, I wasâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen thereâ\\x80\\x99s no problem, is there?â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80¦ well, as long as Shackleboltâ\\x80\\x99s work continues to beâ\\x80¦ erâ\\x80¦ excellent,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cThe one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about him?â\\x80\\x9d asked the Prime Minister.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s only quacking!â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister weakly. â\\x80\\x9cSurely a bit of a restâ\\x80¦ Maybe go easy on the drinkâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA team of Healers from St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x9cI think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦ Heâ\\x80\\x99ll be all right, wonâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister anxiously.\\n\\nScrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x93or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut for heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sakeâ\\x80\\x93youâ\\x80\\x99re wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort outâ\\x80\\x93wellâ\\x80\\x93anything!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nScrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, â\\x80\\x9cThe trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2: Spinnerâ\\x80\\x99s End\\n\\n\\nMany miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbishstrewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fishandchip wrappings in the tall grass.\\n\\nBut then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.\\n\\nWith a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.\\n\\nThe second figure turned over the animal with its toe.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust a fox,â\\x80\\x9d said a womanâ\\x80\\x99s voice dismissively from under the hood. â\\x80\\x9cI thought perhaps an Aurorâ\\x80\\x93Cissy, wait!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCissyâ\\x80\\x93Narcissaâ\\x80\\x93listen to meâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nThe second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo back, Bella!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must listen to me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve listened already. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made my decision. Leave me alone!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe lives here?â\\x80\\x9d asked Bella in a voice of contempt. â\\x80\\x9cHere? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set footâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nBut Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCissy, waitlâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCissy, you must not do this, you canâ\\x80\\x99t trust himâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord trusts him, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord isâ\\x80¦ I believeâ\\x80¦ mistaken,â\\x80\\x9d Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. â\\x80\\x9cIn any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet go, Bella!â\\x80\\x9d snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the otherâ\\x80\\x99s face. Bella merely laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCissy, your own sister? You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do anymore!â\\x80\\x9d Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s arm as though burned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNarcissa!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinnerâ\\x80\\x99s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.\\n\\nShe had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.\\n\\nNarcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNarcissa!â\\x80\\x9d said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a pleasant surprise!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeverus,â\\x80\\x9d she said in a strained whisper. â\\x80\\x9cMay I speak to you? Itâ\\x80\\x99s urgent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her stillhooded sister followed without invitation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnape,â\\x80\\x9d she said curtly as she passed him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBellatrix,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.\\n\\nThey had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candlefilled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.\\n\\nSnape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, what can I do for you?â\\x80\\x9d Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80¦ we are alone, arenâ\\x80\\x99t we?â\\x80\\x9d Narcissa asked quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, of course. Well, Wormtailâ\\x80\\x99s here, but weâ\\x80\\x99re not counting vermin, are we?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape lazily.\\n\\nThe man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNarcissa!â\\x80\\x9d he said, in a squeaky voice. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Bellatrix! How charmingâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWormtail will get us drinks, if youâ\\x80\\x99d like them,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cAnd then he will return to his bedroom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not your servant!â\\x80\\x9d he squeaked, avoiding Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s eye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo assist, yesâ\\x80\\x93but not to make you drinks andâ\\x80\\x93and clean your house!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape silkily. â\\x80\\x9cThis can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can speak to him myself if I want to!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you can,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, sneering. â\\x80\\x9cBut in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elfmade wine will do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the bookcovered door behind him.\\n\\nSnape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord,â\\x80\\x9d he said, raising his glass and draining it.\\n\\nThe sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, â\\x80\\x9cSeverus, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who can help meâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nSnape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy apologies,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cHe has lately taken to listening at doors, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what he means by itâ\\x80¦ You were saying, Narcissa?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe took a great, shuddering breath and started again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeverus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, butâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you ought to hold your tongue!â\\x80\\x9d snarled Bellatrix. â\\x80\\x9cParticularly in present company!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9dPresent companyâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Snape sardonically. â\\x80\\x9cAnd what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat I donâ\\x80\\x99t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNarcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrixâ\\x80\\x99s glowering face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNarcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cWhy is it that you do not trust me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA hundred reasons!â\\x80\\x9d she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. â\\x80\\x9cWhere to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that youâ\\x80\\x99ve lived in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcererâ\\x80\\x99s Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.\\n\\nSnape smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBefore I answer you â\\x80\\x94 oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe hesitated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know he believes you, butâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, â\\x80\\x9cYou ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s orders that I took up the post?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Luciusâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cand many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it isâ\\x80¦ If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99d have me!â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix passionately. â\\x80\\x9cI, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, most admirable,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape in a bored voice. â\\x80\\x9cOf i nurse, you werenâ\\x80\\x99t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGesture!â\\x80\\x9d she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. â\\x80\\x9cWhile I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comlortably playing Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s pet!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot quite,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape calmly. â\\x80\\x9cHe wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse ,.. tempt me into my old ways.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?â\\x80\\x9d she jeered. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHardly,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, â\\x80\\x9calthough the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcomeback present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban isâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you stayed â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Bellatrix, I stayed,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. â\\x80\\x9cI had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you next wanted to know,â\\x80\\x9d he pressed on, ;i little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, â\\x80\\x9cwhy I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcererâ\\x80\\x99s Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBellatrixâ\\x80\\x99s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you didnâ\\x80\\x99t return when he came back, you didnâ\\x80\\x99t fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCorrect. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s orders.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d she began, in tones of outrage.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThink!â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, impatient again. â\\x80\\x9cThink! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, 1 assure you, when I explained that 1 remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what use have you been?â\\x80\\x9d sneered Bellatrix. â\\x80\\x9cWhat useful information have we had from you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cIf he chooses not to share it with you â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe shares everything with me!â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix, firing up at once. â\\x80\\x9cHe calls me his most loyal, his most faithful â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes he?â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. â\\x80\\x9cDoes he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was not my fault!â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix, flushing. â\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious â\\x80\\x94 if Lucius hadnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you dare â\\x80\\x94 donâ\\x80\\x99t you dare blame my husband!â\\x80\\x9d said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no point apportioning blame,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape smoothly. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is done, is done.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not by you!â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix furiously. â\\x80\\x9cNo, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy orders were to remain behind,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And â\\x80\\x94 forgive me â\\x80\\x94 you speak of dangersâ\\x80¦ you were facing six teenagers, were you not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!â\\x80\\x9d snarled Bellatrix. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not the SecretKeeper; I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did nor soften.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?â\\x80\\x9d asked Snape.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80¦ lately, weâ\\x80¦ I am asking you, Snape!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou claim you foresaw his use of the boy!â\\x80\\x9d she jeered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year agoâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why did you keep him alive?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you not understood me? It was only Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and selfsatisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Bellatrix. â\\x80\\x9cHe has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have played my part well,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you overlook Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms â\\x80\\x94 though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard â\\x80\\x94 oh yes, he has,â\\x80\\x9d (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), â\\x80\\x9cthe Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNowâ\\x80¦ you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNarcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Severus. I â\\x80\\x94 I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail andâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,â\\x80\\x9d Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. â\\x80\\x9cHe wishes none to know of the plan. It isâ\\x80¦ very secret. But â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape at once. â\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s word is law.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNarcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere!â\\x80\\x9d she said triumphantly to her sister. â\\x80\\x9cEven Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt so happens that I know of the plan,â\\x80\\x9d he said in a low voice. â\\x80\\x9cI am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you must know about it!â\\x80\\x9d said Narcissa, breathing more freely. â\\x80\\x9cHe trusts you so, Severusâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know about the plan?â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. â\\x80\\x9cYou know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cBut what help do you require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeverus,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. â\\x80\\x9cMy sonâ\\x80¦ my only sonâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDraco should be proud,â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix indifferently. â\\x80\\x9cThe Dark I ,ord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: I Ic isnâ\\x80\\x99t shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNarcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Luciusâ\\x80\\x99s mistake, I know it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s why heâ\\x80\\x99s chosen Draco, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d she persisted. â\\x80\\x9cTo punish Lucius?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf Draco succeeds,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, still looking away from her, â\\x80\\x9che will be honored above all others.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he wonâ\\x80\\x99t succeed!â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Narcissa. â\\x80\\x9cHow can he, when the Dark Lord himselfâ\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only meantâ\\x80¦ that nobody has yet succeededâ\\x80¦ Severusâ\\x80¦ pleaseâ\\x80¦ You are, you have always been, Dracoâ\\x80\\x99s favorite teacherâ\\x80¦ You are Luciusâ\\x80\\x99s old friendâ\\x80¦ I beg youâ\\x80¦ You are the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s favorite, his most trusted advisorâ\\x80¦ Will you speak to him, persuade him â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape flatly. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!â\\x80\\x9d choked Narcissa. â\\x80\\x9cHe does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little selfrestraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, â\\x80\\x9cYou could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, â\\x80\\x9cHe intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn other words, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter to him if Draco is killed!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord is very angry,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Snape quietly. â\\x80\\x9cHe failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the (loor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy only sonâ\\x80¦ my only sonâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou should be proud!â\\x80\\x9d said Bellatrix ruthlessly. â\\x80\\x9cIf I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNarcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, iind steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNarcissa, thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might be possibleâ\\x80¦ for me to help Draco.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe sat up, her face paperwhite, her eyes huge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeverus â\\x80\\x94 oh, Severus â\\x80\\x94 you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can try.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you are there to protect himâ\\x80¦ Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Unbreakable Vow?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnapeâ\\x80\\x99s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArenâ\\x80\\x99t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, heâ\\x80\\x99ll try, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sureâ\\x80¦ The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of actionâ\\x80¦ oh, on the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s orders, of course!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s tearfilled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBellatrixâ\\x80\\x99s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrixâ\\x80\\x99s astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will need your wand, Bellatrix,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape coldly.\\n\\nShe drew it, still looking astonished.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you will need to move a little closer,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nShe stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.\\n\\nNarcissa spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts ta fulfill the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s wishes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape.\\n\\nA thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a redhot wire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape.\\n\\nA second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, should it prove necessaryâ\\x80¦ if it seems Draco will failâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d whispered Narcissa (Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), â\\x80\\x9cwill you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape.\\n\\nBellatrixâ\\x80\\x99s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a fiery snake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3: Will And Wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.\\n\\nThe room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledypiggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk. The headline of one blared:\\n\\nHARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?\\n\\nRumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which HeWhoMustNotBeNamed was sighted once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re not allowed to talk about it, donâ\\x80\\x99t ask me anythingâ\\x80\\x9d said one agitated Obliviator, who refused to give his name as he left the Ministry last night.\\n\\nNevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy.\\n\\nThough Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter â\\x80\\x9cthe Chosen One,â\\x80\\x9d believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of HeWhoMustNo tBeNamed.\\n\\nThe current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown, although {ctd. page2, column 5)\\n\\nA second newspaper lay beside die first. This one bore die headline:\\n\\nSCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE\\n\\nMost of this front page was taken up with a large blackandwhite picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture was moving â\\x80\\x94 the man was waving at the ceiling.\\n\\nRufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizardmg community, though rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour taking office.\\n\\nScrimgeours representatives admitted that he had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 3, column 2)\\n\\nTo the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees studentsâ\\x80\\x99 sapety was visible.\\n\\nNewly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this autumn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,â\\x80\\x9d said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.\\n\\nMost seem reassured by the new Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, â\\x80\\x9cMy grandson, Neville â\\x80\\x94 a good friend of Harry Potterâ\\x80\\x99s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nBut the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage.standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her.\\n\\nA large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that\\n\\ncoated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x94-ISSUED ON BEHALF OFâ\\x80\\x94-\\n\\nThe Ministry of Magic\\n\\nPROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES\\n\\nThe Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your home from attack.\\n\\n1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.\\n\\n2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.\\n\\n3. Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage family members, SideAlongApparition.\\n\\n4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).\\n\\n5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).\\n\\n6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror office immediately.\\n\\n7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.\\n\\nHarry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harryâ\\x80\\x99s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nIf it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.\\n\\nIf you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.\\n\\nKindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday,\\n\\nI am yours most sincerely,\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore\\n\\nThough he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s words; Harry had sent back his â\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.\\n\\nBut Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong â\\x80\\x94 his reply to Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.\\n\\nThe minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window went out.\\n\\nHarry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.\\n\\nHarry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Then as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of clasps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, â\\x80\\x9cWho the blazes is calling at this lime of night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky mid close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, â\\x80\\x9cGood evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of armâ\\x80\\x99s reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waistlength silver hair and beard. Halfmoon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and.1 pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJudging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore pleasantly. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a long time since my last visit,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. â\\x80\\x9cI must say, your agapanthus are flourishing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon â\\x80\\x94 the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point â\\x80\\x94 but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, good evening Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his halfmoon glasses with a most satisfied expression. â\\x80\\x9cExcellent, excellent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThese words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say â\\x80\\x9cexcellentâ\\x80\\x9d was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be rude â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x93yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. â\\x80\\x9cBest to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harryâ\\x80\\x99s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual prebedtime wipedown of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlbus Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. â\\x80\\x9cWe have corresponded, of course.â\\x80\\x9d Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. â\\x80\\x9cAnd this must be your son, Dudley?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDudley had that moment peered round the living room door, his large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and I car. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the â\\x80¢.ilcncc stretched on he smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. I lurry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last lew stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in i he armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArenâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94- arenâ\\x80\\x99t we leaving, sir?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked anxiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to disi us.s first,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I would prefer not to do so in (he open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncleâ\\x80\\x99s hospitality only a little longer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, iind Dudley skulking behind them both.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore simply, â\\x80\\x9cI shall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe may as well be comfortable,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore pleasantly.\\n\\nAs he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â\\x80¢ <Â¦â\\x80\\x99â\\x80¢Â¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir â\\x80\\x94 what happened to your â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLater, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cPlease sit down.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, â\\x80\\x9cbut the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honeycolored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadam Rosmertas finest oakmatured mead,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, turning toward him, â\\x80\\x9ca difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everyihing he owned.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOver on the sofa, Uncle Vernons head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, â\\x80\\x9cOh. Right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is, in the main, fairly straightforward,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore went on. â\\x80\\x9cYou add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at (iringotts, and you inherit all of Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis godfatherâ\\x80\\x99s dead?â\\x80\\x9d said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. 1 )umbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernons head; he attempted to beat it away. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s dead? His godfather?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. â\\x80\\x9cOur problem,â\\x80\\x9d he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, â\\x80\\x9cis that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s been left a house?â\\x80\\x9d said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can keep using it as headquarters,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t care. You can have it, I donâ\\x80\\x99t really want it.â\\x80\\x9d Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is generous,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWe have, however, vacated the building temporarily.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, â\\x80\\x9cBlack family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of â\\x80\\x98Black.â\\x80\\x99 Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mind. â\\x80\\x9cI bet there has,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAnd if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWithout realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s killer, inherit his house?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, obviously we would prefer that she didnâ\\x80\\x99t get it either,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly. â\\x80\\x9cThe situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how are you going to find out if Iâ\\x80\\x99m allowed to own it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFortunately,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cthere is a simple test.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, â\\x80\\x9cWill you get these ruddy things off us?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m so sorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. â\\x80\\x9cBut it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, â\\x80\\x9cif you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a houseelf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant batâ\\x80\\x99s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleysâ\\x80\\x99 shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hairraising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, â\\x80\\x9cWhat the hell is that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreacher,â\\x80\\x9d finished Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreacher wonâ\\x80\\x99t, Kreacher wonâ\\x80\\x99t, Kreacher wonâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d croaked the houseelf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling lii.s ears. â\\x80\\x9cKreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher wonâ\\x80\\x99t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs you can see, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacherâ\\x80\\x99s continued croaks of â\\x80\\x9cwont, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cKreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t care,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping houseelf. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive him an order,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cIf he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, wonâ\\x80\\x99t, WONâ\\x80\\x99T!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nKreacherâ\\x80\\x99s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, â\\x80\\x9cKreacher, shut up!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, that simplifies matters,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore cheerfully. â\\x80\\x9cIt means that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo I â\\x80\\x94 do I have to keep him with me?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked, aghast, us Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot if you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cIf I might make ii suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other houseelves could keep an eye on him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in relief, â\\x80\\x9cyeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do that. Er â\\x80\\x94 Kreacher â\\x80\\x94 I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other houseelves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nKreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upsidedown look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cThere is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once, â\\x80\\x9che can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid will be delighted,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cHe was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeakâ\\x80\\x99s safety, to rechristen him â\\x80\\x98Witherwingsâ\\x80\\x99 for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nErmâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoubtful that I would turn up?â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll just go and â\\x80\\x94 er â\\x80\\x94 finish off,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.\\n\\nIt took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwigâ\\x80\\x99s cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs,\\n\\nHe was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.\\n\\nNobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, â\\x80\\x9cProfessor â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99m ready now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cJust one last thing, then.â\\x80\\x9d And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a years time â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s arrival.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore politely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesnâ\\x80\\x99t turn eighteen until the year after next.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore pleasantly, â\\x80\\x9cbut in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUncle Vernoii muttered, â\\x80\\x9cPreposterous,â\\x80\\x9d but Dumbledore ignored him,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort Was returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parentsâ\\x80\\x99 murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him ;is though he were your own.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBoth Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinclively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUs â\\x80\\x94 mistreat Dudders? What dâ\\x80\\x99you â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his ringer for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house â\\x80\\x98home.â\\x80\\x99 However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNone of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Harryâ\\x80¦ time for us to be off,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak. â\\x80\\x9cUntil we meet again,â\\x80\\x9d he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBye,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harryâ\\x80\\x99s trunk, upon which Hedwigâ\\x80\\x99s cage was perched.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe do not want to be encumbered by these just now,â\\x80\\x9d he said, pulling out his wand again. â\\x80\\x9cI shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloakâ\\x80¦ just in case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4: Horace Slughorn\\n\\n\\nDespite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last facetoface encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harryâ\\x80\\x99s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s most prized possessions.\\n\\nDumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeep your wand at the ready, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d he said brightly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I thought Iâ\\x80\\x99m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf there is an attack,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cI give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are with me,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore simply. â\\x80\\x9cThis will do, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI thought you had to be seventeen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cSo you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind â\\x80\\x94 as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry gripped Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s proffered forearm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWell, here we go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then â\\x80\\x94-\\n\\nHe gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you all right?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. â\\x80\\x9cThe sensation does take some getting used to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m fine,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. â\\x80\\x9cBut I think I might prefer broomsâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck, and said, â\\x80\\x9cThis way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo tell me, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cYour scarâ\\x80¦ has it been hurting at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed i he lightningshaped mark.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s getting so powerful again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI, on the other hand, thought otherwise,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cLord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not complaining,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s mind.\\n\\nThey turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr â\\x80\\x94 where exactly are we?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what are we doing here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh yes, of course, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t told you,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can I help with that, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I think weâ\\x80\\x99ll find a use for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore vaguely. â\\x80\\x9cLeft here, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor, why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t we just Apparate directly into your old colleagueâ\\x80\\x99s house?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cCourtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 you canâ\\x80\\x99t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cHermione Granger told me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd she is quite right. We turn left again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sackedâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCorrect,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. â\\x80\\x9cHe has been replaced, as ] am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs heâ\\x80¦ Do you think heâ\\x80\\x99s good?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn interesting question,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but I meant â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed ii. â\\x80\\x9cAndâ\\x80¦ sirâ\\x80¦ I saw about Madam Bones.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x9cA terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think â\\x80\\x94 ouch.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe had pointed with his injured hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor, what happened to your â\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no time to explain now,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir â\\x80\\x94 I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eatersâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I received one myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, still smiling. â\\x80\\x9cDid you find it useful?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot really.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor future reference, Harry, it is raspberryâ\\x80¦ although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cErâ\\x80¦ right,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWell, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasnâ\\x80\\x99t very clear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are corpses,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly. â\\x80\\x9cDead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizardâ\\x80\\x99s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerfulâ\\x80¦ He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just hereâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.\\n\\nDumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWand out and follow me, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly.\\n\\nHe opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLumos.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him.\\n\\nA scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot pretty, is it?â\\x80\\x9d he said heavily. â\\x80\\x9cYes, something horrible has happened here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around, halfscared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe there was a fight and â\\x80\\x94 and they dragged him off, Professor?â\\x80\\x9d Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean heâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill here somewhere? Yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, â\\x80\\x9cOuch!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood evening, Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, straightening up again.\\n\\nHarrys jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was no need to stick the wand in that hard,â\\x80\\x9d he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. â\\x80\\x9cIt hurt.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s chin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat gave it away?â\\x80\\x9d he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, looking amused, â\\x80\\x9cif the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Mark,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered. â\\x80\\x9cKnew there was somethingâ\\x80¦ ah well. Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have had time anyway, Iâ\\x80\\x99d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you like my assistance clearing up?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore politely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease,â\\x80\\x9d said the other.\\n\\nThey stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.\\n\\nThe furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments relormed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of blood was that, incidentally?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the walls? Dragon,â\\x80\\x9d shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.\\n\\nThere was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, dragon,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the wizard conversationally. â\\x80\\x9cMy last bottle, and prices are skyhigh at the moment. Still, it might be reusable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmm. Bit dusty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho,â\\x80\\x9d he said, his large round eyes flying to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s forehead and the lightningshaped scar it bore. â\\x80\\x9cOho!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, â\\x80\\x9cis Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old Friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. â\\x80\\x9cSo thatâ\\x80\\x99s how you thought youâ\\x80\\x99d persuade me, is it? Well, the answerâ\\x80\\x99s no, Albus.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose we can have a drink, at least?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cFor old timeâ\\x80\\x99s sake?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn hesitated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right then, one drink,â\\x80\\x9d he said ungraciously.\\n\\nDumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmpf,â\\x80\\x9d he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cHere â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, how have you been keeping, Horace?â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot so well,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn at once. â\\x80\\x9cWeak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Canâ\\x80\\x99t move like I used to. Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t have had more than three minutesâ\\x80\\x99 warning?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, â\\x80\\x9cTwo. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still,â\\x80\\x9d he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, â\\x80\\x9cthe fact remains that Iâ\\x80\\x99m an old man, Albus. A tired old man whoâ\\x80\\x99s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not yet as old as I am, Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s injured hand. â\\x80\\x9cReactions not what they were, I see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re quite right,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s neck prickle unpleasantly. â\\x80\\x9c1 am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other handâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, all these precautions against intruders, Horaceâ\\x80¦ are they for the Death Eatersâ\\x80\\x99 benefit, or mine?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat would the Death Eaters want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAre you really telling me that they havenâ\\x80\\x99t come recruiting yet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t given them the chance. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house â\\x80\\x94 the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s been very pleasant, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be sorry to leave. Itâ\\x80\\x99s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors donâ\\x80\\x99t spot you bringing in the piano.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIngenious,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBut it sounds a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If thatâ\\x80\\x99s how you treat teachers these days â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs â\\x80\\x98filthy halfbreeds.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what she did, did she?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cIdiotic woman. Never liked her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said hastily. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just â\\x80\\x94 I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like her either.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore stood up rather suddenly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you leaving?â\\x80\\x9d asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. â\\x80\\x9cSecond on the left down the hall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t think I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why heâ\\x80\\x99s brought you,â\\x80\\x9d he said abruptly.\\n\\nHarry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s watery eyes slid over Harryâ\\x80\\x99s scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou look very like your father.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been told,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcept for your eyes. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got â\\x80\\x94-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, yeah.â\\x80\\x9d Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmpf. Yes, well. You shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,â\\x80\\x9d Slughorn added, in answer to Harrys questioning look. â\\x80\\x9cLily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich was your House?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was Head of Slytherin,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cOh, now,â\\x80\\x9d he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face and wagging a stubby ringer at him, â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t go holding that against me! Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done â\\x80\\x94 been in the papers for the last couple of years â\\x80\\x94 died a few weeks ago â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harryâ\\x80\\x99s intestines and held them tight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, anyway, he was a big pal of your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame â\\x80\\x94 he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d have liked the set.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour mother was Muggleborn, of course. Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pureblood, she was so good.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne of my best friends is Muggleborn,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cand sheâ\\x80\\x99s the best in our year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFunny how that sometimes happens, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot really,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry coldly.\\n\\nSlughorn looked down at him in surprise. â\\x80\\x9cYou mustnâ\\x80\\x99t think Iâ\\x80\\x99m prejudiced!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no! Havenâ\\x80\\x99t I just said your mother was one of my alltime favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too â\\x80\\x94 now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course â\\x80\\x94 another Muggleborn, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goingson at Gringotts!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe bounced up and down a little, smiling in a selfsatisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll exstudents, all signed. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, heâ\\x80\\x99s always interested to hear my take on the dayâ\\x80\\x99s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes â\\x80\\x94 a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave him his first job! And at the back â\\x80\\x94 youâ\\x80\\x99ll see her if you just crane your neck â\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99s Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpiesâ\\x80¦ People are always astonished to hear Iâ\\x80\\x99m on firstname terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.\\n\\nThe smile slid from Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s face as quickly as the blood from his walls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course not,â\\x80\\x9d he said, looking down at Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI have been out of touch with everybody for a year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStillâ\\x80¦ the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure theyâ\\x80\\x99re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I donâ\\x80\\x99t personally fancy the mortality rate â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. â\\x80\\x9cMost of the teachers arenâ\\x80\\x99t in it, and none of them has ever been killed â\\x80\\x94 well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s headmaster; heâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d Harry went on.\\n\\nSlughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harryâ\\x80\\x99s words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yes, it is true that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered grudgingly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters, HeWhoMustNotBeNamed can hardly count me a friendâ\\x80¦ in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albusâ\\x80¦ I cannot pretend that Amelia Bonesâ\\x80\\x99s death did not shake meâ\\x80¦ If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protectionâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, there you are, Albus,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve been a very long lime. Upset stomach?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horaceâ\\x80\\x99s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNot at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn sinned taken aback.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re leaving?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLostâ\\x80¦?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry you donâ\\x80\\x99t want the job, Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. â\\x80\\x9cHogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦ very graciousâ\\x80¦ as I sayâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodbye, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBye,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nThey were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right, all right, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will come out of retirement?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cI must be mad, but yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonderful,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, beaming. â\\x80\\x9cThen, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I daresay you will,â\\x80\\x9d grunted Slughorn.\\n\\nAs they set off down the garden path, Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s voice floated after them, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in surprise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cErâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggleborn should make a good witch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHorace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, â\\x80\\x9clikes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat â\\x80\\x94 more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you all this,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore continued, â\\x80\\x9cnot to turn you against Horace â\\x80\\x94 or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn â\\x80\\x94 but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; â\\x80\\x98the Boy Who Livedâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80¦ or, as they call you these days, â\\x80\\x98the Chosen One.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survivesâ\\x80¦\\n\\nDumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBraced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in thereâ\\x80¦ and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knewâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say â\\x80\\x9cHis godfatherâ\\x80\\x99s dead?â\\x80\\x9d and even worse to hear Siriuss name thrown out casually by Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was cruel,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore softly, â\\x80\\x9cthat you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleysâ\\x80\\x99 lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness i hat he had come to associate with dementors.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just hard,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said finally, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x9cto realize he wonâ\\x80\\x99t write to me again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering his godfatherâ\\x80¦ and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort againâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSirius represented much to you that you had never known before,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore gently. â\\x80\\x9cNaturally, the loss is devastatingâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut while I was at the Dursleysâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, â\\x80\\x9cI realized I cant shut myself away or â\\x80\\x94 or crack up. Sirius wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have wanted that, would he? And anyway, lifeâ\\x80\\x99s too shortâ\\x80¦ Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vanceâ\\x80¦ It could be me next, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t it? But if it is,â\\x80\\x9d he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpoken both like your mother and fatherâ\\x80\\x99s son and Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s true godson!â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s back. â\\x80\\x9cI take my hat off to you â\\x80\\x94 or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Harry, on a closely related subjectâ\\x80¦ I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry again. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now everyone knows that Iâ\\x80\\x99m the one â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they do not,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cThere are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA wise decision, on the whole,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAlthough I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, when Harry looked startled, â\\x80\\x9cI think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t want â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 to worry or frighten them?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles. â\\x80\\x9cOr perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. He continued, â\\x80\\x9cOn a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrivate â\\x80\\x94 with you?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat will you be teaching me, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, a little of this, a little of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore airily.\\n\\nHarry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so ho asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf Iâ\\x80\\x99m having lessons with you, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9dProfessor Snape, Harry â\\x80\\x94 and no, you will not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in relief, â\\x80\\x9cbecause they were a â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think the word â\\x80\\x98fiascoâ\\x80\\x99 would be a good one here,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, nodding.\\n\\nHarry laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, that means I wonâ\\x80\\x99t see much of Professor Snape from now on,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cbecause he wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me carry on Potions unless I get â\\x80\\x98Outstandingâ\\x80\\x99 in my OWL., which I know I havenâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t count your owls before they are delivered,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore gravely. â\\x80\\x9cWhich, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all i imes from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly â\\x80\\x94 all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. â\\x80\\x9cI see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm\\n\\n\\nHarry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s there?â\\x80\\x9d said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cDeclare yourself!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were lucky,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the threshold. â\\x80\\x9cSlughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHello, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9d Wotcher, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Tonks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegumpink hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d better be off,â\\x80\\x9d she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cThanks for the tea and sympathy, Mollyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease donâ\\x80\\x99t leave on my account,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore courteously, â\\x80\\x9cI cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, I need to get going,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Nightâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and MadEye are comingâ\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, really, Mollyâ\\x80¦ thanks anywayâ\\x80¦ Good night, everyone.\\n\\nTonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cTake care of yourself. Molly, your servant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re like Ron,â\\x80\\x9d she sighed, looking him up and down. â\\x80\\x9cBoth of you look as though youâ\\x80\\x99ve had Stretching jinxes put on you. I swear Ronâ\\x80\\x99s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I am,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSit down, dear, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll knock something up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s here?â\\x80\\x9d he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. â\\x80\\x9cEveryoneâ\\x80\\x99s in bed, of course, we didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect you for hours. Here you areâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBread, dear?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks, Mrs. Weasley.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe taught Arthur and me,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cHe was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know what you mean,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. â\\x80\\x9cOf course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s never liked him much. The Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s littered with Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthurâ\\x80¦ didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to think he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether Ronâ\\x80\\x99s told you in any of his lettersâ\\x80¦ itâ\\x80\\x99s only just happenedâ\\x80¦ but Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s been promoted!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.\\n\\nHarry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s great!â\\x80\\x9d he gasped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sweet,â\\x80\\x9d beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. â\\x80\\x9cYes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a big job, heâ\\x80\\x99s got ten people reporting to him now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat exactly?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you see, in all the panic about YouKnowWho, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against YouKnowWho and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thingâ\\x80¦ socalled protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall offâ\\x80¦ Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Hotelier, whoâ\\x80\\x99ve never done an honest dayâ\\x80\\x99s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, itâ\\x80\\x99s a very important job, and I tell him itâ\\x80\\x99s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Mr. Weasley still at work?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he is. As a matter of fact, heâ\\x80\\x99s a tiny bit lateâ\\x80¦ He said heâ\\x80\\x99d be back around midnightâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on i he Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at â\\x80\\x9cmortal peril.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s been like that for a while now,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, â\\x80\\x9cever since YouKnowWho came back into the open. I suppose everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s in mortal danger nowâ\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it can be just our familyâ\\x80¦ but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know anyone else whoâ\\x80\\x99s got a clock like this, so I canâ\\x80\\x99t check. Oh!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clockâ\\x80\\x99s face. Mr. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s hand had switched to â\\x80\\x9ctraveling.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s coming!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, â\\x80\\x9cArthur, is that you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d came Mr. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s weary voice. â\\x80\\x9cBut I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, honestlyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMolly!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right, all rightâ\\x80¦ What is your dearest ambition?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo find out how airplanes stay up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMolly! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to ask you your question first!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArthur, really, this is just sillyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you like me to call you when weâ\\x80\\x99re alone together?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEven by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMollywobbles,â\\x80\\x9d whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCorrect,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cNow you can let me in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, redhaired wizard wearing hornrimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI still donâ\\x80\\x99t see why we have to go through that every time you come home,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, dear, but itâ\\x80\\x99s Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells goodâ\\x80¦ onion soup?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry! We didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect you until morning!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks, Molly. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been a tough night. Some idiotâ\\x80\\x99s started selling MetamorphMedals. Just sling them around your neck and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what really happens when you put them on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s didnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough to do already!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. â\\x80\\x9cAre you sureâ\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I am!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cThe boys wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo is that why youâ\\x80\\x99re late, MetamorphMedals?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got thereâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stifled a yawn behind his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBed,â\\x80\\x9d said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s room all ready for you, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have it to yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, where are they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, theyâ\\x80\\x99re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as theyâ\\x80\\x99re so busy,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cI must say, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunks already up there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Night, Mr. Weasley,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, pushing back his chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGâ\\x80\\x99night, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\nHarry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at â\\x80\\x9cmortal peril.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harryâ\\x80\\x99s school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.\\n\\nHedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purpleandorange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.\\n\\nSeconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWuzzgoinon?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe didnâ\\x80\\x99t know you were here already!â\\x80\\x9d said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRon, donâ\\x80\\x99t hit him!â\\x80\\x9d said a girlâ\\x80\\x99s voice reproachfully.\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though I he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever been better,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. â\\x80\\x9cYou?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot bad,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. â\\x80\\x9cWhen did you get here? Mumâ\\x80\\x99s only just told us!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout one oâ\\x80\\x99clock this morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSame as usual,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed, â\\x80\\x9cthey didnâ\\x80\\x99t talk to me much, but I like it better that way. Howâ\\x80\\x99re you, Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m fine,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the time? Have I missed breakfast?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t worry about that, Mumâ\\x80\\x99s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, rolling his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cSo, whatâ\\x80\\x99s been going on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing much, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncleâ\\x80\\x99s, havenâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome off it!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve been off with Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His nameâ\\x80\\x99s Horace Slughorn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking disappointed. â\\x80\\x9cWe thoughtâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦we thought itâ\\x80\\x99d be something like that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, amused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeahâ\\x80¦ yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, donâ\\x80\\x99t we? So, er, whatâ\\x80\\x99s he like?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSomething wrong, Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like heâ\\x80\\x99ll be a good teacher?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHe canâ\\x80\\x99t be worse than Umbridge, can he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know someone whoâ\\x80\\x99s worse than Umbridge,â\\x80\\x9d said a voice from the doorway. Ronâ\\x80\\x99s younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. â\\x80\\x9cHi, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up with you?â\\x80\\x9d Ron asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s her,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s bed. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s driving me mad.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s she done now?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione sympathetically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the way she talks to meâ\\x80¦ youâ\\x80\\x99d think I was about three!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, dropping her voice. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s so full of herself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t you two lay off her for five seconds?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, defend her,â\\x80\\x9d snapped Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cWe all know you canâ\\x80\\x99t get enough of her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis seemed an odd comment to make about Ronâ\\x80\\x99s mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, â\\x80\\x9cWho are youâ\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor.\\n\\nA young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Arry,â\\x80\\x9d she said in a throaty voice. â\\x80\\x9cEet â\\x80\\x98as been too long!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEet was no trouble,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harryâ\\x80\\x99s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. â\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x98ave been longing to see â\\x80\\x98im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about â\\x80\\x98Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80¦ is she here too?â\\x80\\x9d Harry croaked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, silly boy,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, â\\x80\\x9cI mean next summer, when weâ\\x80¦ but do you not know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHer great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, â\\x80\\x9cWe hadnâ\\x80\\x99t got around to telling him yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBill and I are going to be married!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s gaze. â\\x80\\x9cWow. Erâ\\x80¦ congratulations!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe swooped down upon him and kissed him again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBill is very busy at ze moment, working very â\\x80\\x98ard, and I only work parttime at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me â\\x80\\x98ere for a few days to get to know â\\x80\\x98is family properly. I was so pleased to â\\x80\\x98ear you would be comingâ\\x80¦ zere isnâ\\x80\\x99t much to do â\\x80\\x98ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Wellâ\\x80¦ enjoy your breakfast, â\\x80\\x98Arry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like, â\\x80\\x9ctchah!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMum hates her,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not hate her!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. â\\x80\\x9cI just think theyâ\\x80\\x99ve hurried into this engagement, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve known each other a year,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not very long! I know why itâ\\x80\\x99s happened, of course. Its all this uncertainty with YouKnowWho coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so theyâ\\x80\\x99re rushing all sorts of decisions theyâ\\x80\\x99d normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and centerâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIncluding you and Dad,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny slyly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cWhereas Bill and Fleurâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦ what have they really got in common? Heâ\\x80\\x99s a hardworking, downtoearth sort of person, whereas sheâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA cow,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, nodding. â\\x80\\x9cBut Billâ\\x80\\x99s not that downtoearth. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a CurseBreaker, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamourâ\\x80¦ I expect thatâ\\x80\\x99s why heâ\\x80\\x99s gone for Phlegm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop calling her that, Ginny,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. â\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better get onâ\\x80¦ Eat your eggs while theyâ\\x80\\x99re warm, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLooking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punchdrunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you get used to her if sheâ\\x80\\x99s staying in the same house?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you do,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, â\\x80\\x9cbut if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like thenâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s pathetic,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t really want her around forever?â\\x80\\x9d Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, â\\x80\\x9cWell, Mumâ\\x80\\x99s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x99s she going to manage that?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think sheâ\\x80\\x99s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, Iâ\\x80\\x99d much rather have her in the family.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, thatâ\\x80\\x99ll work,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron sarcastically. â\\x80\\x9cListen, no bloke in his right mindâ\\x80\\x99s going to fancy Tonks when Fleurâ\\x80\\x99s around. I mean, Tonks is okaylooking when she isnâ\\x80\\x99t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, butâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm? said Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd sheâ\\x80\\x99s more intelligent, sheâ\\x80\\x99s an Auror!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione from the corner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFleurâ\\x80\\x99s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot you as well!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione bitterly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you like the way Phlegm says â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x98Any,â\\x80\\x99 do you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ginny scornfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, wishing he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t spoken, â\\x80\\x9cI was just saying, Phlegmâ\\x80¦ I mean, Fleurâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d much rather have Tonks in the family,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cAt least sheâ\\x80\\x99s a laugh.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been much of a laugh lately,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cEvery time Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen her sheâ\\x80\\x99s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s not fair,â\\x80\\x9d snapped Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cShe still hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got over what happenedâ\\x80¦ you knowâ\\x80¦ I mean, he was her cousin!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTonks and Sirius barely knew each other!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cSirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never metâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s not the point,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cShe thinks it was her limit he died!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow does she work that one out?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, in spite of himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have killed Sirius.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s stupid,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s survivorâ\\x80\\x99s guilt,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cI know Lupinâ\\x80\\x99s tried to talk her round, but sheâ\\x80\\x99s still really down. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith herâ\\x80¦?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe canâ\\x80\\x99t change her appearance like she used to,â\\x80\\x9d explained Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cI think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that could happen,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor did I,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cbut I suppose if youâ\\x80\\x99re really depressedâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. â\\x80\\x9cGinny,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered, â\\x80\\x9ccome downstairs and help me with the lunch.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m talking to this lot!â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, outraged.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe only wants me there so she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have to be alone with Phlegm!â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou lot had better come down quickly too,â\\x80\\x9d she said as she left.\\n\\nHarry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping himself to Harryâ\\x80¦s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s this?â\\x80\\x9d Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, â\\x80\\x9cbut if Fred and George left it here, itâ\\x80\\x99s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be carefulâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour mum said the shopâ\\x80\\x99s going well,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSaid Fred and George have got a real flair for business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s an understatement,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re raking in the Galleons! I canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to see the place, we havenâ\\x80\\x99t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dadâ\\x80\\x99s got to be there for extra security and heâ\\x80\\x99s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what about Percy?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry; the thirdeldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. â\\x80\\x9cIs he talking to your mum and dad again?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNope,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being backâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cI heard him telling your mum, Ron.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s going to be giving me private lessons this year,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry conversationally.\\n\\nRon choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou kept that quiet!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI only just remembered,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry honestly. â\\x80\\x9cHe told me last night in your broom shed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlimeyâ\\x80¦ private lessons with Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking impressed. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder why heâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to do itâ\\x80¦ Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know exactly why heâ\\x80\\x99s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, â\\x80\\x9cYou know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNobody knows what it said, though,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione quickly. â\\x80\\x9cIt got smashed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlthough the Prophet saysâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d began Ron, but Hermione said, â\\x80\\x9cShh!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Prophetâ\\x80\\x99s got it right,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, looking up at them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed. â\\x80\\x9cThat glass ball that smashed wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said,â\\x80\\x9d Harry took a deep breath, â\\x80\\x9cit looks like Iâ\\x80\\x99m the one whoâ\\x80\\x99s got to finish off Voldemortâ\\x80¦ At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.\\n\\nHermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI squeezed it and itâ\\x80¦ it punched me!â\\x80\\x9d she gasped.\\n\\nAnd sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t worry,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, â\\x80\\x9cMumâ\\x80\\x99ll fix that, sheâ\\x80\\x99s good at healing minor injuriesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh well, never mind that now!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione hastily. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, oh, Harryâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe sat down on the edge of his bed again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe wondered, after we got back from the Ministryâ\\x80¦ Obviously, we didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like thisâ\\x80¦ Oh, Harryâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d She stared at him, then whispered, â\\x80\\x9cAre you scared?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot as much as I was,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I first heard it, I wasâ\\x80¦ but now, it seems as though I always knew Iâ\\x80\\x99d have to face him in the endâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron eagerly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd we were kind of right, werenâ\\x80\\x99t we? He wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t waste his timeâ\\x80¦ he must think youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a chance!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder what heâ\\x80\\x99ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probablyâ\\x80¦ powerful countercursesâ\\x80¦ antijinxesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦and evasive enchantments generally,â\\x80\\x9d concluded Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cWell, at least you know one lesson youâ\\x80\\x99ll be having this year, thatâ\\x80\\x99s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our OWL results will come?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCant be long now, itâ\\x80\\x99s been a month,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHang on,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, as another part of last nightâ\\x80\\x99s conversation came back to him. â\\x80\\x9cI think Dumbledore said our OWL results would be arriving today!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cToday?â\\x80\\x9d shrieked Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cToday? But why didnâ\\x80\\x99t youâ\\x80¦ oh my Godâ\\x80¦ you should have saidâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe leapt to her feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to see whether any owls have comeâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt just wonâ\\x80\\x99t budge,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healerâ\\x80\\x99s Helpmate open at â\\x80\\x9cBruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis has always worked before, I just canâ\\x80\\x99t understand it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll be Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s idea of a funny joke, making sure it canâ\\x80\\x99t come off,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s got to come off!â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t go around looking like this forever!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wonâ\\x80\\x99t, dear, weâ\\x80\\x99ll find an antidote, donâ\\x80\\x99t worry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley soothingly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBill told me W Fred and George are very amusing!â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur, smiling serenely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,â\\x80\\x9d snapped Hermione.\\n\\nShe jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Weasley, youâ\\x80\\x99re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, dear, Iâ\\x80\\x99d have noticed,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley patiently. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s barely nine, thereâ\\x80\\x99s still plenty of timeâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know I messed up Ancient Runes,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Hermione feverishly, â\\x80\\x9cI definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking backâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione, will you shut up, youâ\\x80\\x99re not the only one whoâ\\x80\\x99s nervous!â\\x80\\x9d barked Ron. â\\x80\\x9cAnd when youâ\\x80\\x99ve got your eleven â\\x80\\x98Outstanding OWLsâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t, donâ\\x80\\x99t, donâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. â\\x80\\x9cI know Iâ\\x80\\x99ve failed everything!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happens if we fail?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Beauxbatons,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur complacently, â\\x80\\x9cwe â\\x80\\x98ad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and thenâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFleurâ\\x80\\x99s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re definitely owls,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd there are three of them,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, hastening to her other side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne for each of us,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a terrified whisper. â\\x80\\x9cOh noâ\\x80¦ oh noâ\\x80¦ oh noâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.\\n\\nThe owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no!â\\x80\\x9d squealed Hermione.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.\\n\\nHarry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.\\n\\nNobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.\\n\\nOrdinary Wizarding Level Results\\n\\nPass Grades:\\n\\nOutstanding (O)\\n\\nExceeds Expectations (E)\\n\\nAcceptable (A)\\n\\nFail Grades:\\n\\nPoor (P)\\n\\nDreadful (D)\\n\\nTroll (T)\\n\\nHarry James Potter has achieved:\\n\\nAstronomy A\\n\\nCare of Magical Creatures E\\n\\nCharms E\\n\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts O\\n\\nDivination P\\n\\nHerbology E\\n\\nHistory of Magic D\\n\\nPotions E\\n\\nTransfiguration E\\n\\nHarry read the parchment through several times, his breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination, but he had passed everything else! He ran his finger down the gradesâ\\x80¦ he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And best of all, he had achieved â\\x80\\x9cOutstandingâ\\x80\\x9d at Defense Against the Dark Arts!\\n\\nHe looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?â\\x80\\x9d he said happily to Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80¦ swapâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry glanced down Ronâ\\x80\\x99s grades: There were no â\\x80\\x9cOutstandingsâ\\x80\\x9d thereâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKnew youâ\\x80\\x99d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve done all right, havenâ\\x80\\x99t we?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ronâ\\x80\\x99s hair. â\\x80\\x9cSeven OWLs, thatâ\\x80\\x99s more than Fred and George got together!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione?â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadnâ\\x80\\x99t turned around. â\\x80\\x9cHow did you do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x93not bad,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a small voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come off it,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. â\\x80\\x9cYepâ\\x80¦ ten â\\x80\\x98Outstandingsâ\\x80\\x99 and one â\\x80\\x98Exceeds Expectationsâ\\x80\\x99 at Defense Against the Dark Arts.â\\x80\\x9d He looked down at her, halfamused, halfexasperated. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re actually disappointed, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, weâ\\x80\\x99re N.E.W.T. students now!â\\x80\\x9d grinned Ron. â\\x80\\x9cMum, are there any more sausages?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regretâ\\x80¦ This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.\\n\\nIt was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks agoâ\\x80¦ Neither can live while the other survivesâ\\x80¦Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6: Dracoâ\\x80\\x99s Detour\\n\\n\\nHarry remained within the confines of the Burrowâ\\x80\\x99s garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days playing twoaside Quidditch in the Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\\n\\nIt would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s displeasure, Harryâ\\x80\\x99s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere have been another couple of dementor attacks,â\\x80\\x9d he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. â\\x80\\x9cAnd theyâ\\x80\\x99ve found Igor Karkaroffâ\\x80\\x99s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over itâ\\x80¦ well, frankly, Iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, well,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps we should talk about something diffâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?â\\x80\\x9d asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. â\\x80\\x9cThe man who ranâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs the icecream place in Diagon Alley?â\\x80\\x9d Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. â\\x80\\x9cHe used to give me free ice creams. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened to him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDragged off, by the look of his place.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho knows? He mustâ\\x80\\x99ve upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTalking of Diagon Alley,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, â\\x80\\x9clooks like Ollivanderâ\\x80\\x99s gone too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe wandmaker?â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, looking startled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the one. Shopâ\\x80\\x99s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut whatâ\\x80\\x99ll people do for wands?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ll make do with other makers,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cBut Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him itâ\\x80\\x99s not so good for us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s included a surprise: he had been made Quidditch Captain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat gives you equal status with prefects!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hermione happily. â\\x80\\x9cYou can use our special bathroom now and everything!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, examining the badge with glee. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, this is so cool, youâ\\x80\\x99re my Captainâ\\x80¦ if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha haâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now youâ\\x80\\x99ve got these,â\\x80\\x9d sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ronâ\\x80¦s booklist. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll go on Saturday as long as your father doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have to go into work again. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going there without him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMum, dâ\\x80\\x99you honestly think YouKnowWhoâ\\x80\\x99s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?â\\x80\\x9d sniggered Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. â\\x80\\x9cIf you think securityâ\\x80\\x99s a laughing matter you can stay behind and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get your things myselfâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s shop!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron hastily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide youâ\\x80\\x99re too immature to come with us!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at â\\x80\\x9cmortal peril,â\\x80\\x9d and balancing it on top of a pile of justlaundered towels. â\\x80\\x9cAnd that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlimeyâ\\x80¦ you canâ\\x80\\x99t even make a joke round here anymoreâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s mine?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s already Harryâ\\x80\\x99s, idiot,â\\x80\\x9d said Bill. â\\x80\\x9cI got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because itâ\\x80\\x99s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up hisâ\\x80¦ Well, trust me, this wayâ\\x80\\x99s easier.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks, Bill,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, pocketing his gold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cE is always so thoughtful,â\\x80\\x9d purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Billâ\\x80\\x99s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.\\n\\nIt was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s good Dad can get us these again,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t get used to it, itâ\\x80\\x99s only because of Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a twoseater sofa. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s been given topgrade security status. And weâ\\x80\\x99ll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere you are, then,â\\x80\\x9d said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m to wait for you, any idea how long youâ\\x80\\x99ll be?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA couple of hours, I expect,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cAh, good, heâ\\x80\\x99s here!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, blackbearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bonecrushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. â\\x80\\x9cBuckbeakâ\\x80¦ Witherwings, I meanâ\\x80¦ yeh should see him, Harry, heâ\\x80\\x99s so happy ter be back in the open airâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGlad heâ\\x80\\x99s pleased,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. â\\x80\\x9cWe didnâ\\x80\\x99t know â\\x80\\x99securityâ\\x80\\x99 meant you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, jusâ\\x80\\x99 like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch oâ\\x80\\x99 Aurors, but Dumbledore said Iâ\\x80\\x99d do,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. â\\x80\\x9cLets get goinâ\\x80\\x99 thenâ\\x80¦ after yeh, Molly, Arthurâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, â\\x80\\x9cJusâ\\x80\\x99 passinâ\\x80\\x99 through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.\\n\\nDiagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blownup versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving blackandwhite photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescueâ\\x80\\x99s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabbylooking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:\\n\\nAMULETS\\n\\nEffective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi!\\n\\nA seedylooking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne for your little girl, madam?â\\x80\\x9d he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cProtect her pretty neck?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I were on dutyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but donâ\\x80\\x99t go arresting anyone now, dear, weâ\\x80\\x99re in a hurry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. â\\x80\\x9cI think weâ\\x80\\x99d better do Madam Malkinâ\\x80\\x99s first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ronâ\\x80\\x99s showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Harry, youâ\\x80\\x99ve grown so muchâ\\x80¦ come on, everyoneâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMolly, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkinâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s schoolbooks?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. â\\x80\\x9cHagrid, do you thinkâ\\x80¦- ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t fret, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be fine with me, Molly,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkinâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nHarry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMighâ\\x80\\x99 be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkinâ\\x80\\x99s and bending down to peer through the window. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll stand guard outside, all right?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ not a child, in case you havenâ\\x80\\x99t noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, â\\x80\\x9cNow, dear, your motherâ\\x80\\x99s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to do with being a childâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWatch where youâ\\x80\\x99re sticking that pin, will you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and whiteblond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,â\\x80\\x9d said Draco Malfoy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think thereâ\\x80\\x99s any need for language like that!â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I donâ\\x80\\x99t want wands drawn in my shop either!â\\x80\\x9d she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, â\\x80\\x9cNo, donâ\\x80\\x99t, honestly, itâ\\x80\\x99s not worth it. â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, like youâ\\x80\\x99d dare do magic out of school,â\\x80\\x9d sneered Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cWho blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s quite enough!â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. â\\x80\\x9cMadam, please!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNarcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPut those away,â\\x80\\x9d she said coldly to Harry and Ron. â\\x80\\x9cIf you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s. He was as tall as she was now. â\\x80\\x9cGoing to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMadam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t accuseâ\\x80¦ dangerous thing to sayâ\\x80¦ wands away, please!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see that being Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore wonâ\\x80\\x99t always be there to protect you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked mockingly all around the shop. â\\x80\\x9cWowâ\\x80¦ look at thatâ\\x80¦ heâ\\x80\\x99s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMalfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!â\\x80\\x9d Malfoy snarled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all right, Draco,â\\x80\\x9d said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cI expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry raised his wand higher.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, no!â\\x80\\x9d moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. â\\x80\\x9cThinkâ\\x80¦ You mustnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80¦ Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be in such troubleâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMadam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me justâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOuch!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. â\\x80\\x9cWatch where youâ\\x80\\x99re putting your pins, woman! Mother, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I want these anymore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkinâ\\x80\\x99s feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re right, Draco,â\\x80\\x9d said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cnow I know the kind of scum that shops hereâ\\x80¦ Weâ\\x80\\x99ll do better at Twilfitt and Tattingâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, really? said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.\\n\\nShe was distracted all through the fitting of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s and Harryâ\\x80\\x99s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizardâ\\x80\\x99s dress robes instead of witchâ\\x80\\x99s, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGot evâ\\x80\\x99rything?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust about,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cDid you see the Malfoys?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, unconcerned. â\\x80\\x9cBu they wouldnâ\\x80¦ dare make trouble in the middle oâ\\x80\\x99 Diagon Alley, Harry. Donâ\\x80\\x99 worry abou1 them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of books.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEveryone all right?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cGot your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80¦ stick close, nowâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe really havenâ\\x80\\x99t got too long,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Weasley said. â\\x80\\x9cSo weâ\\x80\\x99ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, thatâ\\x80\\x99s number ninetytwoâ\\x80¦ ninetyfourâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoa,â\\x80\\x9dsaid Ron, stopping in his tracks.\\n\\nSet against the dull, postermuffled shop Fronts around them, Fred and Georges windows hit the eye like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunnedlooking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The lefthand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harrys eyes began to water just looking at it. The righthand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:\\n\\nWHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOUKNOWWHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT UNOPOOâ\\x80\\x93 THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THATâ\\x80\\x99S GRIPPING THE NATION!\\n\\nHarry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name â\\x80\\x9cUNoPoo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ll be murdered in their beds!â\\x80\\x9d she whispered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo they wonâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. â\\x80\\x9cThis is brilliant!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in SelfInking, SpellChecking, and SmartAnswer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted tenyearolds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: Reusable hangman - spell it or heâ\\x80\\x99ll swing!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPatented Daydream Charmsâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne simple incantation and you will enter a topquality, highly realistic, thirtyminute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to undersixteens. You know,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking up at Harry, â\\x80\\x9cthat really is extraordinary magic!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor that, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said a voice behind them, â\\x80\\x9cyou can have one for free.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow are you, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d They shook hands. â\\x80\\x9cAnd whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened to your eye, Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYour punching telescope,â\\x80\\x9d she said ruefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh blimey, I forgot about those,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred. â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust dab it on, that bruiseâ\\x80\\x99ll be gone within the hour,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred. â\\x80\\x9cWe had to find a decent bruise remover. Weâ\\x80\\x99re testing most of our products on ourselves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione looked nervous. â\\x80\\x9cIt is safe, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCourse it is,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred bracingly. â\\x80\\x9cCome on, Harry, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give you a tour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMuggle magic tricks!â\\x80\\x9d said Fred happily, pointing them out. â\\x80\\x9cFor freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, theyâ\\x80\\x99re great noveltiesâ\\x80¦ Oh, hereâ\\x80\\x99s Georgeâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFredâ\\x80\\x99s twin shook Harrys hand energetically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGiving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, thatâ\\x80\\x99s where weâ\\x80\\x99re making the real moneyâ\\x80¦pocket anything, you, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll pay in more than Galleons!â\\x80\\x9d he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled:\\n\\nEDIBLE DARK MARKSâ\\x80\\x94-THEYâ\\x80\\x99LL MAKE ANYONE SICK!\\n\\nGeorge pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve just developed this more serious line,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred. â\\x80\\x9cFunny how it happenedâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, canâ\\x80\\x99t do a decent Shield Charm,â\\x80\\x9d said George. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Course, they didnâ\\x80\\x99t have you teaching them, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s rightâ\\x80¦ Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And weâ\\x80\\x99re still getting massive orders!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo weâ\\x80\\x99ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Glovesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ I mean, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then we thought weâ\\x80\\x99d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because itâ\\x80\\x99s such a money spinner,â\\x80\\x9d continued George enthusiastically. â\\x80\\x9cThis is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, weâ\\x80\\x99re importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred, pointing at a number of weirdlooking black horntype objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. â\\x80\\x9cYou just drop one surreptitiously and itâ\\x80\\x99ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHandy,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, impressed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere,â\\x80\\x9d said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry.\\n\\nA young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nHarry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called â\\x80\\x9cMr. Weasley,â\\x80\\x9d but they took it in their stride.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight you are, Verity, Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming,â\\x80\\x9d said George promptly. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t do that!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t pay here,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred firmly, waving away Harryâ\\x80\\x99s gold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou gave us our startup loan, we havenâ\\x80\\x99t forgotten,â\\x80\\x9d said George sternly â\\x80\\x9cTake whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGeorge swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHavenâ\\x80\\x99t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?â\\x80\\x9d asked Fred. â\\x80\\x9cFollow me, ladiesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNear the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere you go,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred proudly. â\\x80\\x9cBest range of love potions youâ\\x80\\x99ll find anywhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGinny raised an eyebrow skeptically. â\\x80\\x9cDo they work?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly they work, for up to twentyfour hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in questionâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ and the attractiveness of the girl,â\\x80\\x9d said George, reappearing suddenly at their side. â\\x80\\x9cBut weâ\\x80\\x99re not selling them to our sister,â\\x80\\x9d he added, becoming suddenly stern, â\\x80\\x9cnot when sheâ\\x80\\x99s already got about five boys on the go from what weâ\\x80\\x99veâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatever youâ\\x80\\x99ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGuaranteed tensecond pimple vanisher,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred. â\\x80\\x9cExcellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but donâ\\x80\\x99t change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I am,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cAnd last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting highpitched squeaks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPygmy Puffs,â\\x80\\x9d said George. â\\x80\\x9cMiniature puffskeins, we canâ\\x80¦t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dumped him, he was a bad loser,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re really cute!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re fairly cuddly, yes,â\\x80\\x9d conceded Fred. â\\x80\\x9cBut youâ\\x80\\x99re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGinny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasleyish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didnâ\\x80\\x99t recoil.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s none of your business. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ll thank youâ\\x80\\x9d she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s elbow, laden with merchandise, â\\x80\\x9cnot to tell tales about me to these two!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ronâ\\x80\\x99s arms. â\\x80\\x9cCough up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m your brother!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd thatâ\\x80\\x99s our stuff youâ\\x80\\x99re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll knock off the Knut.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I see you do that again Iâ\\x80\\x99ll jinx your fingers together,â\\x80\\x9d she said sharply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA what?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley warily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook, theyâ\\x80\\x99re so sweetâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonder where his mummy is?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, frowning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGiven her the slip by the looks of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, though?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nHarry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.\\n\\nHarry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.\\n\\nHe glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet under here, quick,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome on,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nShe hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was going in that direction,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear themâ\\x80¦Cmonâ\\x80¦\\n\\nThey scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s him, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d she whispered. â\\x80\\x9cTurning left?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBig surprise,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Ron.\\n\\nFor Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuick, or weâ\\x80\\x99ll lose him,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, speeding up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur feetâ\\x80\\x99ll be seen!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cJust hurry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifactsâ\\x80¦ or at least, to be seen buying them.\\n\\nHermione gave his arm a hard pinch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOuch!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShh! Look! Heâ\\x80\\x99s in there!â\\x80\\x9d she breathed in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\n\\nThey had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oilyhaired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf only we could hear what theyâ\\x80\\x99re saying!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe can!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron excitedly. â\\x80\\x9cHang on, damn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExtendable Ears, look!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFantastic!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. â\\x80\\x9cOh, I hope the door isnâ\\x80\\x99t Imperturbableâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron gleefully. â\\x80\\x9cListen!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ you know how to fix it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPossibly,â\\x80\\x9d said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll need to see it, though. Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you bring it into the shop?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t guarantee anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo?â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps this will make you more confident.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell anyone,â\\x80\\x9d said Maifoy, â\\x80\\x9cand there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? Heâ\\x80\\x99s a family friend. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure youâ\\x80\\x99re giving the problem your full attention.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere will be no need forâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll decide that,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better be off. And donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to keep that one safe, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll need it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps youâ\\x80\\x99d like to take it now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, of course I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just donâ\\x80\\x99t sell it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course notâ\\x80¦ sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBorgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNaturally, naturally,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Borgin, bowing again.\\n\\nNext moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was that about?â\\x80\\x9d whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, thinking hard. â\\x80\\x9cHe wants something mendedâ\\x80¦ and he wants to reserve something in thereâ\\x80¦ Could you see what he pointed at when he said â\\x80\\x98that oneâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he was behind that cabinetâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou two stay here,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are youâ\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHello, horrible morning, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs this necklace for sale?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, pausing beside a glassfronted case.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Borgin coldly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80¦ erâ\\x80¦ no, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got quite that much,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, walking on. â\\x80\\x9cAndâ\\x80¦ what about this lovelyâ\\x80¦ umâ\\x80¦ skull?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSixteen Galleons.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo itâ\\x80\\x99s for sale, then? It isnâ\\x80\\x99t beingâ\\x80¦ kept for anyone?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe thing is, thatâ\\x80¦ erâ\\x80¦ boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, heâ\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if heâ\\x80\\x99s already reserved anything, I obviously donâ\\x80\\x99t want to get him the same thing, soâ\\x80¦ umâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a pretty lame story in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut,â\\x80\\x9d he said sharply. â\\x80\\x9cGet out!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh well,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cWorth a try, but you were a bit obviousâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, next time you can show me how itâ\\x80\\x99s done, Master of Mystery!â\\x80\\x9d she snapped.\\n\\nRon and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxiouslooking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7: The Slug Club\\n\\n\\nHarry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. â\\x80\\x9cBut havenâ\\x80\\x99t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe heâ\\x80\\x99s broken his Hand of Gloryâ\\x80\\x9d said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstickâ\\x80\\x99s bent tail twigs. â\\x80\\x9cRemember that shriveledup arm Malfoy had?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what about when he said, â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t forget to keep that one safeâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry for the umpteenth time. â\\x80\\x9cThat sounded to me like Borginâ\\x80\\x99s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou reckon?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I do,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, â\\x80\\x9cMalfoyâ\\x80\\x99s fatherâ\\x80\\x99s in Azkaban. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99d like revenge?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon looked up, blinking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMalfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s my point, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, frustrated. â\\x80\\x9cBut heâ\\x80\\x99s up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His fatherâ\\x80\\x99s a Death Eater and â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in an anxious voice. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour scarâ\\x80\\x99s not hurting again, is it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron nervously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a Death Eater,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry slowly. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s replaced his father as a Death Eater!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. â\\x80\\x9cMalfoy? Heâ\\x80\\x99s sixteen, Harry! You think YouKnowWho would let Malfoy join?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems very unlikely, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. â\\x80\\x9cWhat makes you think â\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Madam Malkinâ\\x80\\x99s. She didnâ\\x80\\x99t touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. Heâ\\x80\\x99s been branded with the Dark Mark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon and Hermione looked at each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe showed Borgin something we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see,â\\x80\\x9d Harry pressed on stubbornly. â\\x80\\x9cSomething that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know itâ\\x80¦ he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon and Hermione exchanged another look.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure, Harryâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I still donâ\\x80\\x99t reckon YouKnowWho would let Malfoy joinâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnnoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go in the kitchen just now,â\\x80\\x9d she warned him. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of Phlegm around.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be careful not to slip in it.â\\x80\\x9d Harry smiled.\\n\\nSure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of selfpeeling sprouts, looking badtempered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ Bill and I â\\x80\\x98ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be â\\x80\\x98orrible with Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98air!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleurâ\\x80\\x99s monologue. â\\x80\\x9cGood, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Tonks going to be there?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so, sheâ\\x80\\x99s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe has let â\\x80\\x98erself go, zat Tonks,â\\x80\\x9d Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. â\\x80\\x9cA big mistake if you ask.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we donâ\\x80\\x99t have the usual lastminute scramble.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ronâ\\x80\\x99s owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAu revoir, â\\x80\\x98Any,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur throatily, kissing him goodbye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleurâ\\x80\\x99s feet. Furious, redfaced, and dirtspattered, he hurried into the car without saying goodbye.\\n\\nThere was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Cross Station. Instead, two grimfaced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuick, quick, through the barrier,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, who\\n\\nseemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. â\\x80\\x9cHarry had better go first, withâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harryâ\\x80\\x99s upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can walk, thanks,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Aurorâ\\x80\\x99s grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and threequarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.\\n\\nHermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grimfaced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe canâ\\x80\\x99t, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking apologetic. â\\x80\\x9cRon and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to go to the prefectsâ\\x80\\x99 carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yeah, I forgot,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better get straight on the train, all of you, youâ\\x80\\x99ve only got a few minutes to go,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. â\\x80\\x9cWell, have a lovely term, Ronâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.\\n\\nHarry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly,\\n\\nbecause he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.\\n\\nHe could see Mrs. Weasley and the grimfaced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen we were in Diagon Alley,â\\x80\\x9d Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAm I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s shop?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did youâ\\x80¦?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, please. Youâ\\x80\\x99re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cErâ\\x80¦ yeah, all right, we werenâ\\x80\\x99t in the back room.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cVery well, then, letâ\\x80\\x99s hear the worst.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I thought Malfoy was up to something,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s look of mingled exasperation and amusement. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you did,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. â\\x80\\x9cWell? Did you find out why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe went into Borgin and Burkes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cand started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. Andâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry took a deep breath.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think heâ\\x80\\x99s been branded with the Dark Mark. 1 think heâ\\x80\\x99s replaced his father as a Death Eater.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, â\\x80\\x9cHarry, I doubt whether YouKnowWho would allow a sixteenyearoldâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes anyone really know what YouKnowWho would or wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry angrily. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Weasley, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, but isnâ\\x80\\x99t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, itâ\\x80\\x99s probably something Dark or dangerous, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI doubt it, to be honest, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley slowly. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI think you missed something,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry stubbornly. â\\x80\\x9cWell, maybe,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.\\n\\nThere was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better hurry!â\\x80\\x99 said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, â\\x80\\x9cHarry, quickly!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, dear, youâ\\x80\\x99re coming to us for Christmas, itâ\\x80\\x99s all fixed with Dumbledore, so weâ\\x80\\x99ll see you quite soon,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. â\\x80\\x9cYou make sure you look after yourself andâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe train was gathering speed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦be good andâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d , She was jogging to keep up now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦stay safe!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefectsâ\\x80\\x99 carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.\\n\\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the â\\x80\\x9cChosen Oneâ\\x80\\x9d rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFancy trying to find a compartment?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t, Harry, I said Iâ\\x80\\x99d meet Dean,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny brightly. â\\x80\\x9cSee you later.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d said a familiar voice from behind him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeville!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in relief, turning to see a roundfaced boy struggling toward him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHello, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLuna, hi, how are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, thank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuibbler still going strong, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, circulationâ\\x80\\x99s well up,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna happily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s find seats,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. â\\x80\\x9cBecause weâ\\x80\\x99re with you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. â\\x80\\x9cOur little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you mustâ\\x80\\x99ve\\n\\nseen it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,â\\x80\\x9d said Neville, â\\x80\\x9cbut she was really pleased. Says Iâ\\x80\\x99m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCherry and unicorn hair,â\\x80\\x9d he said proudly. â\\x80\\x9cWe think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day â\\x80¦ oi, come back here, Trevor!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d asked Luna,\\n\\nwho was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo point now weâ\\x80\\x99ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI enjoyed the meetings too,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna serenely. â\\x80\\x9cIt was like having friends.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourthyear girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou ask him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNo, you!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd one of them, a boldlooking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Harry, Iâ\\x80\\x99m Romilda, Romilda Vane,â\\x80\\x9d she said loudly and confidently. â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you join us in our compartment? You donâ\\x80\\x99t have to sit with them,â\\x80\\x9d she added in a stage whisper, indicating Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re friends of mine,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry coldly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said the girl, looking very surprised. â\\x80\\x9cOh. Okay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are cool,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry shortly. â\\x80\\x9cNone of them was at the Ministry. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t fight with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a very nice thing to say,â\\x80\\x9d beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The\\n\\nQuibbler.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe didnâ\\x80\\x99t face him, though,â\\x80\\x9d said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resignedlooking Trevor in his hand. â\\x80\\x9cYou did. You should hear my gran talk about you. â\\x80\\x98That Harry Potterâ\\x80\\x99s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!â\\x80\\x99 Sheâ\\x80\\x99d give anything to have you as a grandsonâ\\x80¦\\n\\nHarry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an â\\x80\\x9cAcceptable,â\\x80\\x9d Harry watched him without really listening.\\n\\nNevilleâ\\x80\\x99s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harryâ\\x80\\x99s had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harryâ\\x80\\x99s destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.\\n\\nHad Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightningshaped scar and the weight of the prophecyâ\\x80¦ Or would it? Would Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she wouldâ\\x80¦ But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no â\\x80\\x9cChosen Oneâ\\x80\\x9d at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother, not Ronâ\\x80\\x99s?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou all right, Harry? You look funny,â\\x80\\x9d said Neville.\\n\\nHarry started. â\\x80\\x9cSorry â\\x80¦ I â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWrackspurt got you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80¦ what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA Wrackspurtâ\\x80¦ Theyâ\\x80\\x99re invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI thought I felt one zooming around in here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each otherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.\\n\\nThe weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWish the lunch trolley would hurry up, Iâ\\x80\\x99m starving,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. â\\x80\\x9cHi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?â\\x80\\x9d he added, turning to Harry. â\\x80\\x9cMalfoy s not doing prefect duty. Heâ\\x80\\x99s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did he do when he saw you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe usual,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand\\n\\ngesture. â\\x80\\x9cNot like him, though, is it? Wellâ\\x80¦ that isâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 he did the hand gesture again â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cbut why isnâ\\x80\\x99t he out there bullying first years?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI think heâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless thirdyear girl stepped inside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry PPotter,â\\x80\\x9d she faltered, as her eyes met Harryâ\\x80\\x99s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn invitation,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nHarry,\\n\\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\\n\\nSincerely, Horace\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what does he want me for?â\\x80\\x9d asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo idea,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. â\\x80\\x9cListen,â\\x80\\x9d he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what heâ\\x80\\x99s up to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.\\n\\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, mâ\\x80\\x99boy!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvetcovered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden\\n\\nbuttons on his waistcoat. â\\x80\\x9cGood to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventhyear boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, do you know everyone?â\\x80\\x9d Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. â\\x80\\x9cBlaise Zabini is in your year, of course â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nZabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99ve come across each other â\\x80¦ ? No?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMcLaggen, a large, wiryhaired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ and this is Marcus Belby, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether â\\x80¦?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBelby, who was thin and nervouslooking, gave a strained smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!â\\x80\\x9d Slughorn finished.\\n\\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell now, this is most pleasant,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn cozily. â\\x80\\x9cA chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on\\n\\nlicorice wands, and a poor old manâ\\x80\\x99s digestive system isnâ\\x80\\x99t quite up to such thingsâ\\x80¦ Pheasant, Belby?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBelby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,â\\x80\\x9d Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. â\\x80\\x9cOutstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most welldeserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUnfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnapneo,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNotâ\\x80¦ not much of him, no,â\\x80\\x9d gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, of course, I daresay heâ\\x80\\x99s busy,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. â\\x80\\x9cI doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI supposeâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. â\\x80\\x9cErâ\\x80¦ he and my dad donâ\\x80\\x99t get on very well, you see, so I donâ\\x80\\x99t really know much aboutâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, you, Cormac,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, â\\x80\\x9cI happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yeah, that was fun, that was,â\\x80\\x9d said McLaggen. â\\x80\\x9cWe went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, you know Bertie and Rufus too?â\\x80\\x9d beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. â\\x80\\x9cNow tell meâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influentialâ\\x80¦ everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s parents, wellknown Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parentsâ\\x80\\x99 flair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. â\\x80\\x9cHarry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!â\\x80\\x9d He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The Chosen One,â\\x80\\x99 theyâ\\x80\\x99re calling you now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, â\\x80\\x9cthere have been rumors for yearsâ\\x80¦ I remember when â\\x80¦ well â\\x80¦ after that terrible night â\\x80¦ Lily â\\x80¦ James â\\x80¦ and you survived â\\x80¦ and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nZabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to\\n\\nindicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, Zabini, because youâ\\x80\\x99re so talentedâ\\x80¦ at posingâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear!â\\x80\\x9d chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s great belly. â\\x80\\x9cYou want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous BatBogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t cross her!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nZabini merely looked contemptuous.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyway,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSuch rumors this summer. Of course, one doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes â\\x80¦ but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond â\\x80¦ you were there, then? But the rest of the stories â\\x80¦ so sensational, of course, one doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know quite what to believe â\\x80¦ this fabled prophecy, for instance â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe never heard a prophecy,â\\x80\\x9d said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny staunchly. â\\x80\\x9cNeville and I were both there too, and all this â\\x80\\x98Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were both there too, were you?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦ it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of courseâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. â\\x80\\x9cI remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe meandered off into a longwinded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.\\n\\nThe afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the â\\x80\\x9cSlug Clubâ\\x80\\x9d at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood gracious, itâ\\x80\\x99s getting dark already! I didnâ\\x80\\x99t notice that theyâ\\x80\\x99d lit the lamps! Youâ\\x80\\x99d better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise â\\x80¦ any time youâ\\x80\\x99re passing. Same goes for you, miss,â\\x80\\x9d he twinkled at Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cWell, off you go, off you go!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad thatâ\\x80\\x99s over,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Neville. â\\x80\\x9cStrange man, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYeah, he is a bit,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. â\\x80\\x9cHow come you ended up in there, Ginny?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe saw me hex Zacharias Smith,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cYou remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him â\\x80¦ when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetter reason for inviting someone than because their motherâ\\x80\\x99s famous,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabiniâ\\x80\\x99s head, â\\x80\\x9cor because their uncleâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful ideaâ\\x80¦ In a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixthyear compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherinsâ\\x80¦ If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left â\\x80¦ Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows â\\x80¦ but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harryâ\\x80\\x99s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll see you two later,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut whatâ\\x80\\x99re you â\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d asked Neville.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLater!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.\\n\\nThe corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong with this thing?â\\x80\\x9d said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s foot.\\n\\nHarry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyleâ\\x80\\x99s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabiniâ\\x80\\x99s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbeâ\\x80\\x99s comic directly\\n\\nbelow him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, Zabini,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy, â\\x80\\x9cwhat did Slughorn want?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust trying to make up to wellconnected people,â\\x80\\x9d said Zabini,\\n\\nwho was still glowering at Goyle. â\\x80\\x9cNot that he managed to find\\n\\nmany.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis information did not seem to please Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cWho else had he invited?â\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMcLaggen from Gryffindor,â\\x80\\x9d said Zabini.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yeah, his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s big in the Ministry,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot him, heâ\\x80\\x99s a prat!â\\x80\\x9d said Pansy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,â\\x80\\x9d finished Zabini.\\n\\nMalfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansyâ\\x80\\x99s hand aside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe invited Longbottom?.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,â\\x80\\x9d said Zabini indifferently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nZabini shrugged.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPotter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at â\\x80\\x98the Chosen One,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d sneered Malfoy, â\\x80\\x9cbut that Weasley girl! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s so special about her?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA lot of boys like her,â\\x80\\x9d said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. â\\x80\\x9cEven you think sheâ\\x80\\x99s goodlooking, donâ\\x80\\x99t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,â\\x80\\x9d said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I pity Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s taste. Maybe heâ\\x80\\x99s going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasnâ\\x80\\x99t heard Iâ\\x80\\x99m on the train, orâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t bank on an invitation,â\\x80\\x9d said Zabini. â\\x80\\x9cHe asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old\\n\\nfriends, apparently, but when he heard heâ\\x80\\x99d been caught at the Ministry he didnâ\\x80\\x99t look happy, and Nott didnâ\\x80\\x99t get an invitation, did he? 1 donâ\\x80\\x99t think Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s interested in Death Eaters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMalfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, who cares what heâ\\x80\\x99s interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.â\\x80\\x9d Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, whatâ\\x80\\x99s it matter to me if some fat old hasbeen likes me or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?â\\x80\\x9d said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you never know,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. â\\x80\\x9cI might have â\\x80¦ er â\\x80¦ moved on to bigger and better things.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCrouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you meanâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMalfoy shrugged.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I donâ\\x80\\x99t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about itâ\\x80¦ When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyoneâ\\x80\\x99s got? Of course he isnâ\\x80\\x99t. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you think youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to do something for him?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\n\\nZabini scathingly. â\\x80\\x9cSixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve just said, havenâ\\x80\\x99t I? Maybe he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care if Iâ\\x80\\x99m qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isnâ\\x80\\x99t something that you need to be qualified for,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy quietly.\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so aweinspiring.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can see Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d better get our robes on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\\n\\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.\\n\\nHarry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\\n\\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou go on,â\\x80\\x9d Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. â\\x80\\x9cI just want to check something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.\\n\\nHarry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floorshaking crash, at Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldnâ\\x80\\x99t move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought so,â\\x80\\x9d he said jubilantly. â\\x80\\x9cI heard Goyleâ\\x80\\x99s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came backâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harryâ\\x80\\x99s trainers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got you hereâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s from my father. Now, letâ\\x80\\x99s seeâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMalfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harryâ\\x80\\x99s immobilized body and threw it over him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t reckon theyâ\\x80\\x99ll find you till the trains back in London,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cSee you around, Potterâ\\x80¦ or not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd taking care to tread on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s fingers, Malfoy left the compartment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8 â\\x80\\x94 Victorious Snape\\n\\n\\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone would, surely check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him.\\n\\nHarry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself inâ\\x80¦ and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.\\n\\nRon and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.\\n\\nHe tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words â\\x80\\x9cAccio Wand!â\\x80\\x9d over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.\\n\\nHe thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the faroff hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestraldrawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.\\n\\nThe train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on itâ\\x80¦\\n\\nThen he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, â\\x80\\x9cWotcher, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a flash of red light and Harryâ\\x80\\x99s body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiy Cloak she had just pulled away.\\n\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99d better get out of here, quickly,â\\x80\\x9d she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. â\\x80\\x9cCome on, weâ\\x80\\x99ll jump.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.\\n\\nThe cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho did it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDraco Malfoy,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry bitterly. â\\x80\\x9cThanks forâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo problem,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousyhaired and miserablelookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. â\\x80\\x9cI can fix your nose if you stand still.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stockstill and closed his eyes,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEpiskeyâ\\x80\\x9d said Tonks.\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks a lot!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery fourlegged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9dWas that a Patronus?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sending word to the castle that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got you or theyâ\\x80\\x99ll worry. Come on, weâ\\x80\\x99d better not dawdle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey set off toward the lane that led to the school.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you find me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI noticed you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d check.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what are you doing here, anyway?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it just you whoâ\\x80\\x99s stationed up here, or â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been her fault at all, but he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s death; it was no more her fault than anyone elseâ\\x80\\x99s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonksâ\\x80\\x99s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.\\n\\nHaving always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlohomora!â\\x80\\x9d he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat wonâ\\x80\\x99t work on these,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledore bewitched them himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked around, I could climb a wall,â\\x80\\x9d he suggested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks flatly. â\\x80\\x9cAntiintruder jinxes on all of them. Securityâ\\x80\\x99s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell then,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomeoneâ\\x80\\x99s coming down for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, â\\x80\\x9cLook.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filchâ\\x80\\x99s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well, well,â\\x80\\x9d sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. â\\x80\\x9cNice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t change, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have my â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Harry began, but Snape cut across him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite â\\x80\\x94 ah\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x94 safe in my hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI meant Hagrid to get the message,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, frowning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid was late for the startofterm feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, â\\x80\\x9cI was interested to see your new Patronus.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into place.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you were better off with the old one,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. â\\x80\\x9cThe new one looks weak.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonksâ\\x80\\x99s face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood night,â\\x80\\x9d Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Snape. â\\x80\\x9cThanks for â\\x80¦ everything,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee you, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We havenâ\\x80\\x99t even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze whitehot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way\\n\\nback to London than tell Snape why he was late.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?â\\x80\\x9d Snape continued. â\\x80\\x9cAnd with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStill Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening.\\n\\nThey reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mind, however, Snape said, â\\x80\\x9cNo cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99ve you â\\x80\\x94 blimey, whatâ\\x80\\x99ve you done to your face?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. I\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong with it?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re covered in blood!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cCome here â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe raised her wand, said â\\x80\\x9cTergeo!â\\x80\\x9d and siphoned off the dried blood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, feeling his now clean face. â\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x99s my nose looking?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNormal,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermoine anxiously. â\\x80\\x9cWhy shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Harry, what happened? Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been terrified!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you later,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot now, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t reach too many Gryffindor ears.\\n\\nHe reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou missed the Sorting, anyway,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHat say anything interesting?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMore of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he? It canâ\\x80\\x99t be long now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnape said Hagrid was late for the feast â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve seen Snape? How come?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBumped into him,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry evasively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid was only a few minutes late,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cLook, heâ\\x80\\x99s waving at you, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the startofterm feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harryâ\\x80\\x99s parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to fight Malfoy oneononeâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo what did Professor Slughorn want?â\\x80\\x9d Hermione asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo know what really happened at the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHim and everyone else here,â\\x80\\x9d sniffed Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cPeople were interrogating us about it on the train, werenâ\\x80\\x99t they, Ron?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cAll wanting to know if you really are â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. â\\x80\\x9cI am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. â\\x80\\x98Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,â\\x80\\x99 I told them. â\\x80\\x98I would rather die than betray his trust.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s not saying much, seeing as youâ\\x80\\x99re already dead,â\\x80\\x9d Ron observed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnce again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,â\\x80\\x9d said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe very best of evenings to you!â\\x80\\x9d he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happened to his hand?â\\x80\\x9d gasped Hermione.\\n\\nShe was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s right hand was as blackened and deadlooking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers it the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purpleandgold sleeve over his injury.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing to worry about,â\\x80\\x9d he said airily. â\\x80\\x9cNow â\\x80¦ to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry whispered to Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cI thought heâ\\x80\\x99d have cured it by now, though â\\x80¦ or Madam Pomfrey wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve done.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt looks as if itâ\\x80\\x99s died,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. â\\x80\\x9cBut there are some injuries you canâ\\x80\\x99t cureâ\\x80¦ old cursesâ\\x80¦and there are poisons without antidotes. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 Wizard Wheezes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThose wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year, Professor Slughornâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94 Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cis a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPotions?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPotions?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPotions?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare Harry. â\\x80\\x9cBut you said â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Snape, meanwhile,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering, â\\x80\\x9cwill be taking the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought he was!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.\\n\\nSnape, who was sitting on Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s right, did not stand up his mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thereâ\\x80\\x99s one good thing,â\\x80\\x9d he said savagely. â\\x80\\x9cSnapeâ\\x80\\x99ll be gone by the end of the year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat jobâ\\x80\\x99s jinxed. No ones lasted more than a yearâ\\x80¦ Quirrell actually died doing itâ\\x80¦ Personally, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to keep my fingers crossed for another deathâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, shocked and reproachful.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron reasonably. â\\x80\\x9cThat Slughorn bloke might not want to stay longterm. Moody didnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heartâ\\x80\\x99s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmasterâ\\x80\\x99s words unworthy of his attention.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castleâ\\x80\\x99s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them â\\x80\\x94 in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and othersâ\\x80\\x99 safety.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be wellrested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nosestamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefectâ\\x80\\x99s duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat really happened to your nose?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.\\n\\nHarry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,â\\x80\\x9d he said darkly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, well, never mind that,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry bitterly. â\\x80\\x9cListen to what he was saying before he found out I was thereâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts. With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinsonâ\\x80¦.\\n\\nWhat kind of mission would YouKnowWho have given him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow dâ\\x80\\x99you know Voldemort doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be the first â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish yehâ\\x80\\x99d stop sayinâ\\x80\\x99 tha name, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said a reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagtid shaking his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore uses that name,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry stubbornly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, well, thaâ\\x80\\x99s Dumbledore, innit?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid mysteriously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGot held up on the train,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWhy were you late?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was with Grawp,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid happily. â\\x80\\x9cLosâ\\x80\\x99 track oâ\\x80\\x99 the time. Heâ\\x80\\x99s got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it â\\x80\\x94 nice big cave. Heâ\\x80\\x99s much happier than he was in the forest. We were havinâ\\x80\\x99 a good chat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, taking care not to catch Ronâ\\x80\\x99s eye; the last time he had met Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s halfbrother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yeah, heâ\\x80\\x99s really come on,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid proudly. â\\x80\\x9cYehâ\\x80\\x99ll be amazed. Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinkinâ\\x80\\x99 oâ\\x80\\x99 traininâ\\x80\\x99 him up as me assistant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyway, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see yeh tomorrow, firsâ\\x80\\x99 lessonâ\\x80\\x99s straight after lunch. Come early anâ\\x80\\x99 yeh can say hello ter Buck â\\x80\\x94 I mean, Witherwings!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRaising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the doors into the darkness.\\n\\nHarry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99re not either, are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry shook his head too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x99s not, is she?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\nHarry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d she said uncertainly, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know. It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is â\\x80¦ but thatâ\\x80\\x99s a big lie to tellâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s rude to point,â\\x80\\x9d Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule firstyear boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. â\\x80\\x9cI love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to need that time for studying, Ron!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, but not today,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a real loss, I reckon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHold it!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a limegreen disk clutched tightly in his hand. â\\x80\\x9cFanged Frisbees banned, hand it over,â\\x80\\x9d she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s grip.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always wanted one of these.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermioneâ\\x80\\x99s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ronâ\\x80\\x99s remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.\\n\\nThe ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he canâ\\x80\\x99t really think weâ\\x80\\x99d continue Care of Magical Creatures!â\\x80\\x9d she said, looking distressed. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s it, though, innit?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. â\\x80\\x9cWe were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. Dâ\\x80\\x99ya reckon anyoneâ\\x80\\x99s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.\\n\\nAfter they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagallâ\\x80\\x99s descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.\\n\\nHermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHerbology, fine,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an â\\x80\\x98Outstandingâ\\x80\\x99 O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with â\\x80\\x98Exceeds Expectations.â\\x80\\x99 But the problem is Transfiguration. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, Longbottom, but an â\\x80\\x98Acceptableâ\\x80\\x99 really isnâ\\x80\\x99t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just donâ\\x80\\x99t think youâ\\x80\\x99d be able to cope with the coursework.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeville looked miserable and muttered something about â\\x80\\x9cmy grandmother wants.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmph,â\\x80\\x9d snorted Professot McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson sheâ\\x80\\x99s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNeville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an â\\x80\\x98Exceeds Expectationsâ\\x80\\x99 in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,â\\x80\\x9d mumbled Neville.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTake Charms,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, â\\x80\\x9cand I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.â\\x80\\x9d Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. â\\x80\\x9cThe sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nParvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, Potter, Potter . . .â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. â\\x80\\x9cCharms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration â\\x80¦ all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why havenâ\\x80\\x99t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was, but you told me I had to get an â\\x80\\x98Outstandingâ\\x80\\x99 in my O.W.L., Professor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with â\\x80\\x98Exceeds Expectationsâ\\x80\\x99 at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbut I didnâ\\x80\\x99t buy the books or any ingredients or anything-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cVery well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought youâ\\x80\\x99d get that, well done,â\\x80\\x9d she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s chest. â\\x80\\x9cTell me when you call trials!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be stupid,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mustnâ\\x80\\x99t start off like that,â\\x80\\x9d she said warningly. â\\x80\\x9cFor all you know, thereâ\\x80\\x99s someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friendsâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourthyear student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanksâ\\x80\\x99s yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.\\n\\nAn hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking putupon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe got so much homework for Runes,â\\x80\\x9d she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. â\\x80\\x9cA fifteeninch essay, two translations, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to read these by Wednesday!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShame,â\\x80\\x9d yawned Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wait,â\\x80\\x9d she said resentfully. â\\x80\\x9cI bet Snape gives us loads.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInside,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not asked you to take out your books,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. â\\x80\\x9cI wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s than anyone elseâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYou believe . . . like you havenâ\\x80\\x99t watched them all come and go, hoping youâ\\x80\\x99d be next, thought Harry scathingly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. â\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Arts,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, â\\x80\\x9care many, varied, everchanging, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a manyheaded monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour defenses,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, a little louder, â\\x80\\x9cmust therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These picturesâ\\x80\\x9d - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - â\\x80\\x9cgive a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curseâ\\x80\\x9d - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - â\\x80\\x9cfeel the Dementorâ\\x80\\x99s Kissâ\\x80\\x9d - a wizard lying huddled and blankeyed, slumped against a wall - â\\x80\\x9cor provoke the aggression of the Inferiusâ\\x80\\x9d - a bloody mass upon ground.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas an Inferius been seen, then?â\\x80\\x9d said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. â\\x80\\x9cIs it definite, is he using them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, â\\x80\\x9cwhich means you would be welladvised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nHe set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. ,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermioneâ\\x80\\x99s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, â\\x80\\x9cVery well - Miss Granger?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour adversary has no warning about what kind of magic youâ\\x80\\x99re about to perform,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cwhich gives you a splitsecond advantage.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), â\\x80\\x9cbut correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spellcasting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which someâ\\x80\\x9d - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - â\\x80\\x9clack.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will now divide,â\\x80\\x9d Snape went on, â\\x80\\x9cinto pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlthough Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s muttered JellyLegs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.\\n\\nRon, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPathetic, Weasley,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, after a while. â\\x80\\x9cHere â\\x80\\x94 let me show you-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nHe turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, â\\x80\\x9cProtego!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked offbalance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry stiffly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no need to call me â\\x80\\x99sir,â\\x80\\x99 Professor.â\\x80\\x9d The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDetention, Saturday night, my office,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cI do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even â\\x80\\x98the Chosen One.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was brilliant, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou really shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have said it,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, frowning at Ron. â\\x80\\x9cWhat made you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe tried to jinx me, in case you didnâ\\x80\\x99t notice!â\\x80\\x9d fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he use another guinea pig for a change? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cI thought he sounded a bit like you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLike me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, when you were telling us what itâ\\x80\\x99s like to face Voldemort. You said it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quickthinking?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry! Hey, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last yearâ\\x80\\x99s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor you,â\\x80\\x9d panted Sloper. â\\x80\\x9cListen, I heard youâ\\x80\\x99re the new Captain. Whenâ\\x80\\x99re you holding trials?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure yet,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll let you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, right. I was hoping itâ\\x80\\x99d be this weekend -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in midsentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.\\n\\nDear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe enjoys Acid Pops?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who had read the message over Harryâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder and was looking perplexed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in a low voice. â\\x80\\x9cHa! Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s not going to be pleased. . . . I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to do his detention!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their afterlunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoonâ\\x80\\x99s double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nWhen they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry,â\\x80\\x9d Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, â\\x80\\x9cdidnâ\\x80\\x99t get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron â\\x80\\x94 Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBefore they could say more than â\\x80\\x9cfine,â\\x80\\x9d the dungeon door opened and Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.\\n\\nThe dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a goldcolored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potionâ\\x80\\x99s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow then, now then, now then,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. â\\x80\\x9cScales out, everyone, and potion kits, and donâ\\x80\\x99t forget your copies\\n\\nof Advanced PotionMaking. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, raising his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, mâ\\x80\\x99boy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t got a book or scales or anything - norâ\\x80\\x99s Ron - we didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize weâ\\x80\\x99d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure we can lend you some scales, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve got a small stock of old books here, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s foraging, emerged with two very batteredlooking copies of Advanced PotionMaking by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow then,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of â\\x80\\x98em, even if you havenâ\\x80\\x99t made â\\x80\\x98em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.\\n\\nHermioneâ\\x80\\x99s wellpracticed hand hit the air before anybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s; Slughorn pointed at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good, very good!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn happily. â\\x80\\x9cNow,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, â\\x80\\x9cthis one here is pretty well knownâ\\x80¦ Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately tooâ\\x80¦ Who can - ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermioneâ\\x80\\x99s hand was fastest once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cltâ\\x80\\x99s Polyjuice Potion, sir,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nHarry too had recognized the slowbubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. â\\x80\\x9cExcellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s hand punched the air again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s Amortentia!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, â\\x80\\x9cbut I assume you know what it does?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the most powerful love porion in the world!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive motherofpearl sheen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the steam rising in characteristic spirals,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione enthusiastically, â\\x80\\x9cand itâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nBut she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98May I ask your name, my dear?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, ignoring Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s embarrassment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione Granger, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGranger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector DagworthGranger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so, sir. Iâ\\x80\\x99m Muggleborn, you see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho! â\\x80\\x98One of my best friends is Muggleborn, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s the best in our year!â\\x80\\x99 Iâ\\x80\\x99m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well, take twenty wellearned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn genially.\\n\\nMalfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, â\\x80\\x9cDid you really tell him Iâ\\x80\\x99m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, whatâ\\x80\\x99s so impressive about that?â\\x80\\x9d whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. â\\x80\\x9cYou are the best in the year - Iâ\\x80\\x99d've told him so if heâ\\x80\\x99d asked me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione smiled but made a â\\x80\\x9cshhingâ\\x80\\x9d gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmortentia doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,â\\x80\\x9d he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, â\\x80\\x9cit is time for us to start work.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, you havenâ\\x80\\x99t told us whatâ\\x80\\x99s in this one,â\\x80\\x9d said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. â\\x80\\x9cYes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,â\\x80\\x9d he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, â\\x80\\x9cthat you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s liquid luck,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione excitedly. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes you lucky!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cDesperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed â\\x80¦ at least until the effects wear off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t people drink it all the time, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said Terry Boot eagerly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cToo much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you ever taken it, sir?â\\x80\\x9d asked Michael Corner with great interest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwice in my life,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cOnce when I was twentyfour, once when I was fiftyseven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, â\\x80\\x9cis what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. â\\x80\\x9cEnough for twelve hoursâ\\x80\\x99 luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, â\\x80\\x9chow are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking., It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.\\n\\nTo his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could.\\n\\nEveryone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the â\\x80\\x9csmooth, black currantcolored liquidâ\\x80\\x9d mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.\\n\\nHaving finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:\\n\\nCrush with flat side of silver dagger,\\n\\nreleases juice better than cutting.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?â\\x80\\x9d Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, â\\x80\\x9cI was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t unexpected, dragon pox at his ageâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.\\n\\nThe sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan I borrow your silver knife?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.\\n\\nHarry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all.\\n\\nHastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.\\n\\nHis annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?\\n\\nHarry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow are you doing that?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAdd a clockwise stir -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, the book says counterclockwise!â\\x80\\x9d she snapped.\\n\\nHarry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .\\n\\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one elseâ\\x80\\x99s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd timeâ\\x80\\x99s . . . up!â\\x80\\x9d called Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cStop stirring, please!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ronâ\\x80\\x99s cauldron. He passed over Ernieâ\\x80\\x99s navy concoction. Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harryâ\\x80\\x99s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe clear winner!â\\x80\\x9d he cried to the dungeon. â\\x80\\x9cExcellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, itâ\\x80\\x99s clear youâ\\x80\\x99ve inherited your motherâ\\x80\\x99s talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherinsâ\\x80\\x99 faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you do that?â\\x80\\x9d he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGot lucky, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.\\n\\nOnce they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s face became stonier with every word he uttered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI sâ\\x80\\x99pose you think I cheated?â\\x80\\x9d he finished, aggravated by her expression.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly your own work, was it?â\\x80\\x9d she said stiffly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe only followed different instructions to ours,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, â\\x80\\x9cCouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been a catastrophe, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t it? But he took a risk and it paid off.â\\x80\\x9d He heaved a sigh. â\\x80\\x9cSlughorn couldâ\\x80\\x99ve handed me that book, but no, I get the one no oneâ\\x80\\x99s ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fiftytwo, but-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHang on,â\\x80\\x9d said a voice close by Harryâ\\x80\\x99s left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. â\\x80\\x9cDid I hear right? Youâ\\x80\\x99ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing,â\\x80\\x9d he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not like, you know, Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s diary. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just an old textbook someoneâ\\x80\\x99s scribbled on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut youâ\\x80\\x99re doing what it says?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing funny -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGinnyâ\\x80\\x99s got a point,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, perking up at once. â\\x80\\x9cWe ought to check that thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHey!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and raised her wand. â\\x80\\x9cSpecialis Revelio!â\\x80\\x9d she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dogeared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFinished?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry irritably. â\\x80\\x9cOr dâ\\x80\\x99you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems all right,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, it really does seem to be â\\x80¦ just a textbook.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood. Then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have it back,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.\\n\\nThis book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10: The Hour of Gaunt\\n\\n\\nFor or the rest of the weekâ\\x80\\x99s Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borageâ\\x80\\x99s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the â\\x80\\x9cofficialâ\\x80\\x9d instructions, but becoming increasingly badtempered as they yielded poorer results than the Princeâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nHarry wondered vaguely who the HalfBlood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced PotionMaking, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potionmaking. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr herself,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. â\\x80\\x9cIt might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girlâ\\x80\\x99s than a boyâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe HalfBlood Prince, he was called,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said. â\\x80\\x9cHow many girls have been Princes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down.\\n\\nHarry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking back into his bag.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s five to eight, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better go, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be late for Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOoooh!â\\x80\\x9d gasped Hermione, looking up at once. â\\x80\\x9cGood luck! Weâ\\x80\\x99ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHope it goes okay,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole.\\n\\nHarry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirtylooking playing cards, reading them as she walked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo of spades: conflict,â\\x80\\x9d she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. â\\x80\\x9cSeven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe stopped dead, right on the other side of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s statue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, that canâ\\x80\\x99t be right,â\\x80\\x9d she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventhfloor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAcid Pops,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s Office.\\n\\nHarry knocked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore s voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood evening, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, walking into the headmasterâ\\x80\\x99s office.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, good evening, Harry. Sit down,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cI hope youâ\\x80\\x99ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, thanks, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cEr,â\\x80\\x9d began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. â\\x80\\x9cYou have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these â\\x80\\x94 for want of a better word â\\x80\\x94 lessons?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.â\\x80\\x9d There was a pause.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. â\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d he added.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd so I did,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore placidly. â\\x80\\x9cI told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you think youâ\\x80\\x99re right?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNaturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being â\\x80\\x94 forgive me â\\x80\\x94 rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry tentatively, â\\x80\\x9cdoes what youâ\\x80\\x99re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather, â\\x80\\x9cand I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou look worried.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere are we going, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor a trip down Bob Ogdenâ\\x80\\x99s memory lane,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silverywhite substance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho was Bob Ogden?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall â\\x80\\x94shall I, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo matter, Harry â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir â\\x80\\x94 how did you injure your hand?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. â\\x80\\x9cAfter you,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.\\n\\nThey were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forgetmenot. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the lefthand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped onepiece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.\\n\\nDumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile.\\n\\nThey walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frockcoated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.\\n\\nOgden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogdenâ\\x80\\x99s frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.\\n\\nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.\\n\\nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes discerned the building halfhidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.\\n\\nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.\\n\\nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not welcome.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr â\\x80\\x94 good morning. Iâ\\x80\\x99m from the Ministry of Magic â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not welcome.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry â\\x80\\x94 I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden nervously.\\n\\nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou understand him, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x9cYes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, slightly nonplussed. â\\x80\\x9cWhy canâ\\x80\\x99t Ogden â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s speaking Parseltongue?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.\\n\\nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, look â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMorfin!â\\x80\\x9d said a loud voice.\\n\\nAn elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMinistry, is it?â\\x80\\x9d said the older man, looking down at Ogden. â\\x80\\x9cCorrect!â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSâ\\x80\\x99right,â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt. â\\x80\\x9cGot you in the face, did he?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, he did!â\\x80\\x9d snapped Ogden.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShouldâ\\x80\\x99ve made your presence known, shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt aggressively. â\\x80\\x9cThis is private property. Canâ\\x80\\x99t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDefend himself against what, man?â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden, clambering back to his feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBusybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.â\\x80\\x9d Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. â\\x80\\x9cGet in the house. Donâ\\x80\\x99t argue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s your son Iâ\\x80\\x99m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. â\\x80\\x9cThat was Morfin, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, that was Morfin,â\\x80\\x9d said the old man indifferently. â\\x80\\x9cAre you pureblood?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, suddenly aggressive.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s neither here nor there,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently.\\n\\nHe squinted into Ogdenâ\\x80\\x99s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, â\\x80\\x9cNow I come to think about it, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen noses like yours down in the village.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t doubt it, if your sonâ\\x80\\x99s been let loose on them,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps we could continue this discussion inside?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInside?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Mr. Gaunt. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve already told you. Iâ\\x80\\x99m here about Morfin. We sent an owl â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve no use for owls,â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t open letters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden tartly. â\\x80\\x9cI am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right, all right, all right!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Gaunt. â\\x80\\x9cCome in the bleeding house, then, and much good itâ\\x80\\x99ll do you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:\\n\\nHissy, hissy, little snakey, Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or heâ\\x80\\x99ll nail you to the door.\\n\\nThere was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalidlooking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeatedlooking person.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMâ\\x80\\x99daughter, Merope,â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood morning,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden.\\n\\nShe did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Gaunt,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden, â\\x80\\x9cto get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPick it up!â\\x80\\x9d Gaunt bellowed at her. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, whatâ\\x80\\x99s your wand for, you useless sack of muck?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Gaunt, please!â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.\\n\\nMorfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, â\\x80\\x9cMend it, you pointless lump, mend it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMerope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, â\\x80\\x9cReparo. â\\x80\\x9d The pot mended itself instantly.\\n\\nGaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, â\\x80\\x9cLucky the nice man from the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s here, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Perhaps heâ\\x80\\x99ll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mind dirty Squibs. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWithout looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Gaunt,â\\x80\\x9d Ogden began again, â\\x80\\x9cas Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said: the reason for my visit â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI heard you the first time!â\\x80\\x9d snapped Gaunt. â\\x80\\x9cAnd so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him â\\x80\\x94 what about it, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMorfin has broken Wizarding law,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden sternly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Morfin has broken Wizarding law.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Gaunt imitated Ogdenâ\\x80\\x99s voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. â\\x80\\x9cHe taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, thatâ\\x80\\x99s illegal now, is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s that, then, his sentence?â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSummons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you think weâ\\x80\\x99re scum, do you?â\\x80\\x9d screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellownailed finger pointing at his chest. â\\x80\\x9cScum whoâ\\x80\\x99ll come running when the Ministry tells â\\x80\\x98em to? Do you know who youâ\\x80\\x99re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right!â\\x80\\x9d roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, blackstoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogdenâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. â\\x80\\x9cSee this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries itâ\\x80\\x99s been in our family, thatâ\\x80\\x99s how far back we go, and pureblood all the way! Know how much Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve really no idea,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, â\\x80\\x9cand itâ\\x80\\x99s quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee this?â\\x80\\x9d he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see it, I see it!â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden hastily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSlytherins!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Gaunt. â\\x80\\x9cSalazar Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s! Weâ\\x80\\x99re his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Gaunt, your daughter!â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo!â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you go talking to us as if weâ\\x80\\x99re dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all â\\x80\\x94 more than you can say, I donâ\\x80\\x99t doubt!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Gaunt,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden doggedly, â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our informationâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 he glanced down at his scroll of parchment â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cis that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMorfin giggled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe quiet, boy,â\\x80\\x9d snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd so what if he did, then?â\\x80\\x9d Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, â\\x80\\x9cI expect youâ\\x80\\x99ve wiped the Muggleâ\\x80\\x99s filthy face clean for him, and his memory to bootâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden. â\\x80\\x9cThis was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAr, I had you marked out as a Mugglelover the moment I saw you,â\\x80\\x9d sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis discussion is getting us nowhere,â\\x80\\x9d said Ogden firmly. â\\x80\\x9cIt is clear from your sonâ\\x80\\x99s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.â\\x80\\x9d He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. â\\x80\\x9cMorfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOgden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God, what an eyesore!â\\x80\\x9d rang out a girlâ\\x80\\x99s voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. â\\x80\\x9cCouldnâ\\x80\\x99t your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not ours,â\\x80\\x9d said a young manâ\\x80\\x99s voice. â\\x80\\x9cEverything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The sonâ\\x80\\x99s quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. â\\x80\\x9cKeep your seat,â\\x80\\x9d said his father warningly, in Parseltongue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTom,â\\x80\\x9d said the girlâ\\x80\\x99s voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, â\\x80\\x9cI might be wrong â\\x80\\x94 but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood lord, youâ\\x80\\x99re right!â\\x80\\x9d said the manâ\\x80\\x99s voice. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99ll be the son, I told you heâ\\x80\\x99s not right in the head. Donâ\\x80\\x99t look at it, Cecilia, darling.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Darling,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Darling, he called her. So he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have you anyway.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMerope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say, Morfin?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe likes looking at that Muggle,â\\x80\\x9d said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. â\\x80\\x9cAlways in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she? And last night â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nMerope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, â\\x80\\x9cHanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt quietly.\\n\\nAll three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it true?â\\x80\\x9d said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. â\\x80\\x9cMy daughterâ\\x80\\x94pureblooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin â\\x80\\x94 hankering after a filthy, dirtveined Muggle?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMerope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I got him, Father!â\\x80\\x9d cackled Morfin. â\\x80\\x9cI got him as he went by and he didnâ\\x80\\x99t look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!â\\x80\\x9d roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s throat.\\n\\nBoth Harry and Ogden yelled â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, â\\x80\\x9cRelaskio!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.\\n\\nOgden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Meropeâ\\x80\\x99s screams echoing in his ears.\\n\\nOgden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, darkhaired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horseâ\\x80\\x99s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pellmell up the lane.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that will do, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s now twilit office.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happened to the girl in the cottage?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. â\\x80\\x9cMerope, or whatever her name was?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, she survived,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. â\\x80\\x9cOgden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarvolo?â\\x80\\x9d Harry repeated wonderingly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. â\\x80\\x9cI am glad to see youâ\\x80\\x99re keeping up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat old man was â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVoldemortâ\\x80\\x99s grandfather, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cMarvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Merope,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cso Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s mother?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt does,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAnd it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s father. I wonder whether you noticed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, beaming. â\\x80\\x9cYes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd they ended up married?â\\x80\\x9d Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you are forgetting,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cthat Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Imperius Curse?â\\x80\\x9d Harry suggested. â\\x80\\x9cOr a love potion?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squireâ\\x80\\x99s son ran off with the trampâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, Merope.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the villagersâ\\x80\\x99 shock was nothing to Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death â\\x80\\x94 or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Merope? She â\\x80¦ she died, didnâ\\x80\\x99t she? Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWe must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being â\\x80\\x98hoodwinkedâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98taken in.â\\x80\\x99 What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she did have his baby.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat went wrong?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did the love potion stop working?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAgain, this is guesswork,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cbut I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the babyâ\\x80\\x99s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office seemed to glow more brightly than before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that will do for tonight, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore after a moment or two.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nHe got to his feet, but did not leave.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir â\\x80¦ is it important to know all this about Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s past?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery important, I think,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd itâ\\x80¦ itâ\\x80\\x99s got something to do with the prophecy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt has everything to do with the prophecy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.\\n\\nHe turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. â\\x80\\x9cSir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything youâ\\x80\\x99ve told me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, â\\x80\\x9cYes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s secrets.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make sure itâ\\x80\\x99s just Ron and Hermione. Good night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindlelegged tables that supported so many fraillooking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, staring at it. â\\x80\\x9cThat ringâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I was,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore agreed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut isnâ\\x80\\x99t itâ\\x80¦ sir, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore bowed his head. â\\x80\\x9cThe very same.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how come â\\x80\\x94 ? Have you always had it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I acquired it very recently,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cA few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncleâ\\x80\\x99s, in fact.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAround that time, yes, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, how exactly â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cToo late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood night, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11: Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s helping hand\\n\\n\\nAs Hermione had predicted, the sixth yearsâ\\x80\\x99 free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s increasing resentment, Harryâ\\x80\\x99s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the HalfBlood Prince.\\n\\nNonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on UNoPoo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.\\n\\nOne result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got to go and explain,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking up at Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cAnd weâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe didnâ\\x80\\x99t hate it!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak for yourself, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t forgotten the skrewts,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron darkly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x99m telling you now, weâ\\x80\\x99ve had a narrow escape. You didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear him going on about his gormless brother â\\x80\\x94 weâ\\x80\\x99d have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if weâ\\x80\\x99d stayed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hate not talking to Hagrid,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking upset.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll go down after Quidditch,â\\x80\\x9d Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. â\\x80\\x9cBut trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied.â\\x80\\x9d He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. â\\x80\\x9cI dunno why the teamâ\\x80\\x99s this popular all of a sudden.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come on, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, suddenly impatient. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not Quidditch thatâ\\x80\\x99s popular, itâ\\x80\\x99s you! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve never been more interesting, and frankly, youâ\\x80\\x99ve never been more fanciable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEveryone knows youâ\\x80\\x99ve been telling the truth now, donâ\\x80\\x99t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now theyâ\\x80\\x99re calling you â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94 well, come on, canâ\\x80\\x99t you see why people are fascinated by you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hurt that youâ\\x80\\x99ve grown about a foot over the summer either,â\\x80\\x9d Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m tall,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron inconsequentially.\\n\\nThe post owls arrived, swooping down through rainflecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHa!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced PotionMaking, fresh from Flourish and Blotts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh good,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, delighted. â\\x80\\x9cNow you can give that graffitied copy back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you mad?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m keeping it! Look, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve thought it out â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, â\\x80\\x9cDijjindo!â\\x80\\x9d The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brandnew book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, â\\x80\\x9cReparo!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere sat the Princeâ\\x80\\x99s copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll give Slughorn back the new one, he canâ\\x80\\x99t complain, it cost nine Galleons.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that dayâ\\x80\\x99s copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyone we know dead?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but there have been more dementor attacks,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cAnd an arrest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent, who?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. â\\x80\\x9cStan Shunpike,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, startled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStan Shunpike, a Death Eater?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. â\\x80\\x9cNo way!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might have been put under the Imperius Curse,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron reasonably. â\\x80\\x9cYou never can tell.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look like it,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, who was still reading. â\\x80\\x9cIt says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eatersâ\\x80\\x99 secret plans in a pub.â\\x80\\x9d She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. â\\x80\\x9cIf he was under the Imperius Curse, heâ\\x80\\x99d hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cIsnâ\\x80\\x99t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, thatâ\\x80\\x99s him,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI dunno what theyâ\\x80\\x99re playing at, taking Stan seriously.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey probably want to look as though theyâ\\x80\\x99re doing something,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cPeople are terrified â\\x80\\x94 you know the Patil twinsâ\\x80\\x99 parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, goggling at Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cBut Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and weâ\\x80\\x99ve got Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99ve got him all the time,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. â\\x80\\x9cHavenâ\\x80\\x99t you noticed? His seatâ\\x80\\x99s been empty as often as Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s this past week.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmasterâ\\x80\\x99s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think heâ\\x80\\x99s left the school to do something with the Order,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a low voice. â\\x80\\x9cI mean . . . itâ\\x80\\x99s all looking serious, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.\\n\\nWhen they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twinsâ\\x80\\x99 parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harryâ\\x80\\x99s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.\\n\\nAs Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiryhaired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe met on the train, in old Sluggyâ\\x80\\x99s compartment,â\\x80\\x9d he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harryâ\\x80\\x99s hand. â\\x80\\x9cCormac McLaggen, Keeper.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t try out last year, did you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,â\\x80\\x9d said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. â\\x80\\x9cAte a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWell. . . if you wait over there â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggenâ\\x80\\x99s face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both â\\x80\\x9cold Sluggyâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d favorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts.\\n\\nThe second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.\\n\\nThe third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf thereâ\\x80\\x99s anyone else here whoâ\\x80\\x99s not from Gryffindor,â\\x80\\x9d roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, â\\x80\\x9cleave now, please!\\n\\nThere was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.\\n\\nAfter two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s my final decision and if you donâ\\x80\\x99t get out of the way of the Keepers Iâ\\x80\\x99ll hex you,â\\x80\\x9d he bellowed.\\n\\nNeither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broadchested thirdyear boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.\\n\\nHarry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.\\n\\nNone of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harryâ\\x80\\x99s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.\\n\\nRon looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. â\\x80\\x9cGood luck!â\\x80\\x9d cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.\\n\\nYet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggenâ\\x80\\x99s red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis sister didnâ\\x80\\x99t really try,â\\x80\\x9d said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernonâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cShe gave him an easy save.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRubbish,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry coldly. â\\x80\\x9cThat was the one he nearly missed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMcLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive me another go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ronâ\\x80\\x99s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.\\n\\nHarry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done,â\\x80\\x9d he croaked. â\\x80\\x9cYou flew really well â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did brilliantly, Ron!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.\\n\\nAfter fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,â\\x80\\x9d Ron was saying happily. â\\x80\\x9cTricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, you were magnificent,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking amused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was better than that McLaggen anyway,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. â\\x80\\x9cDid you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like heâ\\x80\\x99d been Confunded. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo Harryâ\\x80\\x99s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.\\n\\nThe great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s cabin. He clicked his razorsharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione nervously. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s still a bit scary, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome off it, youâ\\x80\\x99ve ridden him, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow are you?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. â\\x80\\x9cMissing him? But youâ\\x80\\x99re okay here with Hagrid, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOi!â\\x80\\x9d said a loud voice.\\n\\nHagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGit away from him! Heâ\\x80\\x99ll have yer fingers â\\x80\\x94 oh. Itâ\\x80\\x99s yeh lot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking stricken.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t worry about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly. â\\x80\\x9cHagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no sound from within.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t open the door, weâ\\x80\\x99ll blast it open!â\\x80\\x9d Harry said, pulling out his wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, sounding shocked. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t possibly â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I can!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cStand back â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a teacher!â\\x80\\x9d he roared at Harry. â\\x80\\x9cA teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, sirâ\\x80\\x9d said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.\\n\\nHagrid looked stunned. â\\x80\\x9cSince when have yeh called me â\\x80\\x99sirâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSince when have you called me â\\x80\\x98Potterâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, very clever,â\\x80\\x9d growled Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cVery amusinâ\\x80\\x99. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s me outsmarted, innit? All righâ\\x80\\x99, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harryâ\\x80\\x99s knee and drooling all over his robes. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s this? Feelinâ\\x80\\x99 sorry for me? Reckon Iâ\\x80\\x99m lonely or summat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once. â\\x80\\x9cWe wanted to see you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve missed you!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione tremulously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMissed me, have yeh?â\\x80\\x9d snorted Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cYeah. Righâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucketsized mugs of mahoganybrown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s cooking, and took one at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, â\\x80\\x9cwe really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe did!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cBut none of us could fit it into our schedules!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah. Righâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid again.\\n\\nThere was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like footlong maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are they, Hagrid?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJusâ\\x80\\x99 giant grubs,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd they grow into â\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking apprehensive.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey wonâ\\x80\\x99 grow inter nuthinâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cI got â\\x80\\x98em ter feed ter Aragog.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd without warning, he burst into tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s. . . him . ..â\\x80\\x9d gulped Hagrid, his beetleblack eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s . . . Aragog. â\\x80¦ I think heâ\\x80\\x99s dyinâ\\x80\\x99. . , . He got ill over the summer anâ\\x80\\x99 heâ\\x80\\x99s not gettinâ\\x80\\x99 betterâ\\x80¦. I donâ\\x80\\x99 know what Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do if he â\\x80¦ if he â\\x80¦ Weâ\\x80\\x99ve bin tergether so long. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione patted Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a halfbrother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there â\\x80\\x94 is there anything we can do?â\\x80\\x9d Hermione asked, ignoring Ronâ\\x80\\x99s frantic grimaces and headshakings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99 think there is, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. â\\x80\\x9cSee, the rest oâ\\x80\\x99 the tribe â\\x80¦ Aragogâ\\x80\\x99s family . . . theyâ\\x80\\x99re gettinâ\\x80\\x99 a bit funny now heâ\\x80\\x99s illâ\\x80¦ bit restive â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in an undertone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99 reckon itâ\\x80\\x99d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the moâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. â\\x80\\x9cBut thanks fer offerinâ\\x80\\x99, Hermione. â\\x80¦ It means a lot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAr, I always knew yehâ\\x80\\x99d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,â\\x80\\x9d he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. â\\x80\\x9cEven if yeh applied fer TimeTurners â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have done,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cWe smashed the entire stock of Ministry TimeTurners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAr, well then,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no way yeh couldâ\\x80\\x99ve done it. â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry Iâ\\x80\\x99ve bin â\\x80\\x94 yeh know â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve jusâ\\x80\\x99 bin worried about Aragog â\\x80¦ an I did wonder whether, if Professor GrubblyPlank had bin teachinâ\\x80\\x99 yeh â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor GrubblyPlank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m starving,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got much time for dinner.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s arm and held her back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione defensively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you ask me,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quietly, â\\x80\\x9cMcLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione blushed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, all right then, I did it,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered. â\\x80\\x9cBut you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, heâ\\x80\\x99s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didnâ\\x80\\x99t get in â\\x80\\x94 you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have wanted someone like that on the team.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cNo, I suppose thatâ\\x80\\x99s true. But wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, youâ\\x80\\x99re a prefect, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, be quiet,â\\x80\\x9d she snapped, as he smirked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you two doing?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harryâ\\x80\\x99s stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!â\\x80\\x9d he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, â\\x80\\x9cI was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? Weâ\\x80\\x99re having a little party, just a few rising stars, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin â\\x80\\x94 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries â\\x80\\x94 and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t come, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got a detention with Professor Snape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, his face falling comically. â\\x80\\x9cDear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you both later!â\\x80\\x9d He bustled away out of the Hall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s got no chance of persuading Snape,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. â\\x80\\x9cThis detentionâ\\x80\\x99s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it for anyone else.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I wish you could come, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go on my own!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI doubt youâ\\x80\\x99ll be alone, Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99ll probably be invited,â\\x80\\x9d snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.\\n\\nAfter dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnything new?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot really. . .â\\x80\\x9d Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. â\\x80\\x9cOh, look, your dadâ\\x80\\x99s in here, Ron â\\x80\\x94 heâ\\x80\\x99s all right!â\\x80\\x9d she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. â\\x80\\x9cIt just says heâ\\x80\\x99s been to visit the Malfoysâ\\x80\\x99 house. â\\x80\\x98This second search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tipoff.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, mine!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if itâ\\x80\\x99s not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how can he have done, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. â\\x80\\x9cWe were all searched when we arrived, werenâ\\x80\\x99t we?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere you?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, taken aback. â\\x80\\x9cI wasnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no, of course you werenâ\\x80\\x99t, I forgot you were late. Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy canâ\\x80\\x99t have brought in anything dangerous!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMomentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomeoneâ\\x80\\x99s sent it to him by owl, then,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHis mother or someone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll the owls are being checked too,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cFilch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nReally stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you think of any way Malfoy â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, drop it, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen, itâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, firing up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, as Iâ\\x80\\x99m not invited to any parties,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, getting to his feet again, â\\x80\\x9cI think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stomped off toward the door to the boysâ\\x80\\x99 dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry?â\\x80\\x9d said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got a message for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom Professor Slughorn?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo â\\x80¦ from Professor Snape,â\\x80\\x9d said Demelza. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart sank. â\\x80\\x9cHe says youâ\\x80\\x99re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention â\\x80\\x94 er â\\x80\\x94 no matter how many party invitations youâ\\x80\\x99ve received. And he wanted you to know youâ\\x80\\x99ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and â\\x80\\x94 and he says thereâ\\x80\\x99s no need to bring protective gloves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry grimly. â\\x80\\x9cThanks a lot, Demelza.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\\n\\n\\nWhere was Dumbledore, and what was he doing?\\n\\nHarry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.\\n\\nHalfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.\\n\\nHarry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced PotionMaking. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the HalfBlood Princes copy of Advanced PotionMaking hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossingsout and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.\\n\\nHarry had already attempted a few of the Princeâ\\x80\\x99s selfinvented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.\\n\\nSitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossingsout and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:\\n\\nLevicorpus (nvbl)\\n\\nWhile the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . that had to mean â\\x80\\x9cnonverbal.â\\x80\\x9d Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.\\n\\nPointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. â\\x80\\x9cAaaaaaaargh!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced PotionMaking flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of Bed. â\\x80\\x9cHang on â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you down â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered the cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counterjinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTomorrow,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in a muffled voice, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather you set the alarm clock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBy the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys handknitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ronâ\\x80\\x99s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harryâ\\x80\\x99s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ and then there was another flash, of light and I landed on the bed again!â\\x80\\x9d Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.\\n\\nHermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?â\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\n\\nHarry frowned at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlways jump to the worst conclusion, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell. . . yeah, it was, but so what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy does it matter if itâ\\x80\\x99s handwritten?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause itâ\\x80\\x99s probably not Ministry of Magic approved,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cAnd also,â\\x80\\x9d she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, â\\x80\\x9cbecause Iâ\\x80\\x99m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBoth Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was a laugh!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. â\\x80\\x9cJust a laugh, Hermione, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDangling people upside down by the ankle?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cWho puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFred and George,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, shrugging, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s their kind of thing. And, erâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dad,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. He had only just remembered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron and Hermione together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dad used this spell,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 Lupin told me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the HalfBlood Prince possibly be â\\x80\\x94 ?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe your dad did use it, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cbut heâ\\x80\\x99s not the only one. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case youâ\\x80\\x99ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was different,â\\x80\\x9d he said robustly. â\\x80\\x9cThey were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You donâ\\x80\\x99t like the Prince, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, â\\x80\\x9cbecause heâ\\x80\\x99s better than you at Potions â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s got nothing to do with that!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. â\\x80\\x9cI just think itâ\\x80\\x99s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you donâ\\x80\\x99t even know what theyâ\\x80\\x99re for, and stop talking about â\\x80\\x98the Princeâ\\x80\\x99 as if itâ\\x80\\x99s his title, I bet itâ\\x80\\x99s just a stupid nickname, and it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see where you get that from,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry heatedly. â\\x80\\x9cIf heâ\\x80\\x99d been a budding Death Eater he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been boasting about being â\\x80\\x98halfblood,â\\x80\\x99 would he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEven as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pureblood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Death Eaters canâ\\x80\\x99t all be pureblood, there arenâ\\x80\\x99t enough pureblood wizards left,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione stubbornly. â\\x80\\x9cI expect most of them are halfbloods pretending to be pure. Itâ\\x80\\x99s only Muggleborns they hate, theyâ\\x80\\x99d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no way theyâ\\x80\\x99d let me be a Death Eater!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. â\\x80\\x9cMy whole family are blood traitors! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s as bad as Muggleborns to Death Eaters!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd theyâ\\x80\\x99d love to have me,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry sarcastically. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d be best pals if they didnâ\\x80\\x99t keep trying to do me in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHey, Harry, Iâ\\x80\\x99m supposed to give you this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a scroll of parchment with Harryâ\\x80\\x99s name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks, Ginny. . . Itâ\\x80\\x99s Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s next lesson!â\\x80\\x9d Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. â\\x80\\x9cMonday evening!â\\x80\\x9d He felt suddenly light and happy. â\\x80\\x9cWant to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going with Dean â\\x80\\x94 might see you there,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, waving at them as she left.\\n\\nFilch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triplechecking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat does it matter if weâ\\x80\\x99re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. â\\x80\\x9cSurely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.\\n\\nThe walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonkoâ\\x80\\x99s Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank God,â\\x80\\x9d shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffeescented air. â\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s stay here all afternoon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, mâ\\x80\\x99boy!â\\x80\\x9d said a booming voice from behind them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, thatâ\\x80\\x99s three of my little suppers youâ\\x80\\x99ve missed now!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. â\\x80\\x9cIt wonâ\\x80\\x99t do, mâ\\x80\\x99boy, Iâ\\x80\\x99m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione helplessly, â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99re really â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo why donâ\\x80\\x99t you come along, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbonadorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cBut a little recreation never hurt any body. Now, how about Monday night, you canâ\\x80\\x99t possibly want to practice in this weatherâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t, Professor, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got â\\x80\\x94 er â\\x80\\x94 an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnlucky again!â\\x80\\x9d cried Slughorn dramatically. â\\x80\\x9cAh, well . . . you canâ\\x80\\x99t evade me forever, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t believe youâ\\x80\\x99ve wriggled out of another one,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, shaking her head. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not that bad, you know. . . Theyâ\\x80\\x99re even quite fun sometimes. . . .â\\x80\\x9d But then she caught sight of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s expression. â\\x80\\x9cOh, look â\\x80\\x94 theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got deluxe sugar quills â\\x80\\x94 those would last hours!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGlad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new extralarge sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s go to the Three Broomsticks,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll be warm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rainwashed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMundungus!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe squat, bandylegged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, â\\x80\\x98ello, â\\x80\\x98Arry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. â\\x80\\x9cWell, donâ\\x80\\x99t let me keep ya.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you selling this stuff?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubbylooking objects from the ground.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, gotta scrape a living,â\\x80\\x9d said Mundungus. â\\x80\\x9cGimme that!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon had stooped down and picked up something silver.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHang on,â\\x80\\x9d Ron said slowly. â\\x80\\x9cThis looks familiar â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you!â\\x80\\x9d said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s hand and stuffing it back into the case. â\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you all _ OUCH!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d squealed Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou took that from Sinusâ\\x80\\x99s house,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. â\\x80\\x9cThat had the Black family crest on it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 no â\\x80\\x94 what â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?â\\x80\\x9d snarled Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 no â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive it to me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue.\\n\\nThere was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungusâ\\x80\\x99s throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then â\\x80\\x94 CRACKâ\\x80\\x94 he Disapparated.\\n\\nHarry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCOME BACK, YOU THIEVING â\\x80\\x94 !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no point, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMundungus will probably be in London by now. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no point yelling.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s nicked Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s stuff! Nicked it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but still,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. â\\x80\\x9cYou should get out of the cold.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks. The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, â\\x80\\x9cHe was nicking Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s stuff!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, Harry, but please donâ\\x80\\x99t shout, people are staring,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cGo and sit down, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get you a drink.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t the Order control Mundungus?â\\x80\\x9d Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t they at least stop him stealing everything thatâ\\x80\\x99s not fixed down when heâ\\x80\\x99s at headquarters?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShh!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, Iâ\\x80\\x99d be annoyed too, I know itâ\\x80\\x99s your things heâ\\x80\\x99s stealingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, itâ\\x80\\x99s my stuff!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cNo wonder he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t pleased to see me! Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to tell Dumbledore whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on, heâ\\x80\\x99s the only one who scares Mundungus.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood idea,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. â\\x80\\x9cRon, what are you staring at?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI expect â\\x80\\x98nothingâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x99 in the back getting more firewhisky,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione waspishly.\\n\\nRon ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, â\\x80\\x9cShall we call it a day and go back to school, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifootâ\\x80\\x99s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.\\n\\nIt was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to do with you, Leanne!â\\x80\\x9d Harry heard Katie say.\\n\\nThey rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harryâ\\x80\\x99s glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.\\n\\nAt once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.\\n\\nThen, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katieâ\\x80\\x99s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katieâ\\x80\\x99s legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.\\n\\nHarry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStay there!â\\x80\\x9d he shouted at the others over the howling wind. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going for help!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid!â\\x80\\x9d he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. â\\x80\\x9cJusâ\\x80\\x99 bin visitinâ\\x80\\x99 Grawp, heâ\\x80\\x99s cominâ\\x80\\x99 on so well yeh wouldnâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid, someoneâ\\x80\\x99s hurt back there, or cursed, or something â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWha ?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomeoneâ\\x80\\x99s been cursed!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCursed? Whoâ\\x80\\x99s bin cursed â\\x80\\x94 not Ron? Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, itâ\\x80\\x99s not them, itâ\\x80\\x99s Katie Bell â\\x80\\x94 this way . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTogether they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet back!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cLemme see her!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomethingâ\\x80\\x99s happened to her!â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Leanne. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katieâ\\x80\\x99s piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind.\\n\\nHermione hurried over to Katieâ\\x80\\x99s wailing friend and put an arm around her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s Leanne, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe girl nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid it just happen all of a sudden, or â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was when that package tore,â\\x80\\x9d sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brownpaper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t touch it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that before,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, staring at the thing. â\\x80\\x9cIt was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it.â\\x80\\x9d He looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. â\\x80\\x9cHow did Katie get hold of this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it. â\\x80¦ Oh no, oh no, I bet sheâ\\x80\\x99d been Imperiused and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLeanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe didnâ\\x80\\x99t say whoâ\\x80\\x99d given it to her, Leanne?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo . . . she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and â\\x80\\x94 and â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLeanne let out a wail of despair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d better get up to school,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ronâ\\x80\\x99s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nAs they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMalfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!â\\x80\\x9d ,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 I dunno, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron hesitantly. â\\x80\\x9cLoads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didnâ\\x80\\x99t that girl say Katie got it in the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 bathroom?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didnâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily get it in the bathroom itselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMcGonagall!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron warningly.\\n\\nHarry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell â\\x80\\x94 upstairs to my office at once, please! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s that youâ\\x80\\x99re holding, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the thing she touched,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood lord,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Filch, theyâ\\x80\\x99re with me!â\\x80\\x9d she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. â\\x80\\x9cTake this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleetspattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d she said sharply. â\\x80\\x9cWhat happened?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHaltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word out of her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, â\\x80\\x9cgo up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happened when Katie touched the necklace?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe rose up in the air,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, â\\x80\\x9cand then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAway?â\\x80\\x9d Harry repeated angrily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Potter, away!â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall tartly. â\\x80\\x9cBut anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a lifeanddeath matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOn one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a very serious accusation, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. â\\x80\\x9cDo you have any proof?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbutâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin.\\n\\nWhen he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMalfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t have it with him. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Harry,â\\x80\\x9d Hermione interrupted, â\\x80\\x9cBorgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause he didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to touch it, obviously!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat he actually said was, â\\x80\\x98How would I look carrying that down the street?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,â\\x80\\x9d interjected Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Ron,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione despairingly, â\\x80\\x9cit would be all wrapped up, so he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street â\\x80\\x94 and in any case,â\\x80\\x9d she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, â\\x80\\x9cI asked Borgin about the necklace, donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t say it was already sold or anything â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t going to tell you â\\x80\\x94 anyway, Malfoy couldâ\\x80\\x99ve sent off for it since â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s enough!â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. â\\x80\\x9cPotter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I said â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d muttered Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 and what is more,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, â\\x80\\x9cMr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry gaped at her, deflating.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know, Professor?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d she said as she marched past them, â\\x80\\x9cbut I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.\\n\\nHarry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodness only knows,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cBut whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been meant for loads of people,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledore â\\x80\\x94 the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn â\\x80\\x94 Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they canâ\\x80\\x99t be pleased that heâ\\x80\\x99s sided with Dumbledore. Or â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr you,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking troubled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cor Katie wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, Malfoy wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in Hogsmeade!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe must have used an accomplice, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cCrabbe or Goyle â\\x80\\x94 or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, heâ\\x80\\x99ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now heâ\\x80\\x99s joined up â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no point arguing with him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDilligrout,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.\\n\\nThe portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katieâ\\x80\\x99s fate had not yet spread.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. â\\x80\\x9cThe curse didnâ\\x80\\x99t even make it into the castle. Not what youâ\\x80\\x99d call foolproof.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re right,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t very well thoughtout at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut since when has Malfoy been one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s great thinkers?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione answered him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13: The Secret Riddle\\n\\n\\nKatie was removed to St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, and Malfoy knows, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his MalfoyIsaDeathEater theory.\\n\\nHarry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday nightâ\\x80\\x99s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have had a busy time while I have been away,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore said. â\\x80\\x9cI believe you witnessed Katieâ\\x80\\x99s accident.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. How is she?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy him?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cWhy not Madam Pomfrey?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpertinent,â\\x80\\x9d said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s greatgreatgrandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. â\\x80\\x9cI would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thank you, Phineas,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quellingly. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere were you this weekend, sir?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would rather not say just now,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, I shall tell you in due course.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, startled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I expect so,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry tentatively, â\\x80\\x9cI met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with lightfingered contempt,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, frowning a little. â\\x80\\x9cHe has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s old possessions.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat mangy old halfblood has been stealing Black heirlooms?â\\x80\\x9d said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, after a short pause, â\\x80\\x9cdid Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe told me of your suspicions, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd do you â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katieâ\\x80\\x99s accident,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBut what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his longfingered hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know she was in London, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cwho, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, â\\x80\\x98Oh, this was Merlinâ\\x80\\x99s, this was, his favorite teapot,â\\x80\\x99 but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore gave the Pensieve an extravigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe only gave her ten Galleons?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry indignantly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCaractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cSo we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s treasured family heirlooms.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she could do magic!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cShe could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps she could. But it is my beliefâ\\x80\\x94I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right â\\x80\\x94 that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even stay alive for her son?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. â\\x80\\x9cCould you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly, â\\x80\\x9cbut she had a choice, didnâ\\x80\\x99t she, not like my mother â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour mother had a choice too,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore gently. â\\x80\\x9cYes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your motherâ\\x80\\x99s courage. And now, if you will stand â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere are we going?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis time,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cwe are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, oldfashioned London street.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere I am,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horsedrawn milk cart.\\n\\nThis younger Albus Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNice suit, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, before he could stop himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said the bewilderedlooking girl, taking in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s eccentric appearance. â\\x80\\x9cUm. . . just a moâ\\x80\\x99 . . . MRS. COLE!â\\x80\\x9d she bellowed over her shoulder.\\n\\nHarry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cCome in, sheâ\\x80\\x99s on â\\x80\\x98er way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassedlooking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharpfeatured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalleyâ\\x80\\x99s oozing all over his sheets â\\x80\\x94 chicken pox on top of everything else,â\\x80\\x9d she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood afternoon,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, holding out his hand. Mrs. Cole simply gaped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, â\\x80\\x9cOh yes. Well â\\x80\\x94 well then â\\x80\\x94 youâ\\x80\\x99d better come into my room. Yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you family?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I am a teacher,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI have come to offer Tom a place at my school.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat schoolâ\\x80\\x99s this, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is called Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how come youâ\\x80\\x99re interested in Tom?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe believe he has qualities we are looking for.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean heâ\\x80\\x99s won a scholarship? How can he have done? Heâ\\x80\\x99s never been entered for one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, his name has been down for our school since birth â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho registered him? His parents?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Coleâ\\x80\\x99s desktop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, â\\x80\\x9cI think this will make everything clear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Coleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat seems perfectly in order,â\\x80\\x9d she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr â\\x80\\x94 may I offer you a glass of gin?â\\x80\\x9d she said in an extrarefined voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you very much,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, beaming.\\n\\nIt soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didnâ\\x80\\x99t hesitate to press his advantage.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. â\\x80\\x9cI remember it clear as anything, because Iâ\\x80\\x99d just started here myself. New Yearâ\\x80\\x99s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid she say anything before she died?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAnything about the boyâ\\x80\\x99s father, for instance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, as it happens, she did,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. â\\x80\\x9cI remember she said to me, â\\x80\\x98I hope he looks like his papa,â\\x80\\x99 and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty â\\x80\\x94 and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father â\\x80\\x94 yes, I know, funny name, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus â\\x80\\x94 and she said the boyâ\\x80\\x99s surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we named him just as sheâ\\x80\\x99d said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and heâ\\x80\\x99s been here ever since.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a funny boy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI thought he might be.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was. . . odd.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOdd in what way?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore gently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s definitely got a place at your school, you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDefinitely,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd nothing I say can change that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll be taking him away, whatever?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatever,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Dumbledore gravely.\\n\\nShe squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, â\\x80\\x9cHe scares the other children.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean he is a bully?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think he must be,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBilly Stubbsâ\\x80\\x99s rabbit. . . well, Tom said he didnâ\\x80\\x99t do it and I donâ\\x80\\x99t see how he could have done, but even so, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t hang itself from the rafters, did it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t think so, no,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And thenâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9con the summer outing â\\x80\\x94 we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside â\\x80\\x94 well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that theyâ\\x80\\x99d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore theyâ\\x80\\x99d just gone exploring, but something happened in there, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou understand, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though twothirds of the gin was now gone. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose youâ\\x80\\x99d like to see him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery much,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, rising too.\\n\\nShe led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They looked reasonably wellcared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere we are,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTom? Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton â\\x80\\x94 sorry, Dunderbore. Heâ\\x80\\x99s come to tell you â\\x80\\x94 well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let him do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a book.\\n\\nThere was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, darkhaired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s eccentric appearance. There was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you do, Tom?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand.\\n\\nThe boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am Professor Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Professorâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Riddle. He looked wary. â\\x80\\x9cIs that like â\\x80\\x98doctorâ\\x80\\x99? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle. â\\x80\\x9cShe wants me looked at, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t she? Tell the truth!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school â\\x80\\x94 your new school, if you would like to come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddleâ\\x80\\x99s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t kid me! The asylum, thatâ\\x80\\x99s where youâ\\x80\\x99re from, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? â\\x80\\x98Professor,â\\x80\\x99 yes, of course â\\x80\\x94 well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going, see? That old catâ\\x80\\x99s the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not from the asylum,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore patiently. â\\x80\\x9cI am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like to see them try,â\\x80\\x9d sneered Riddle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s last words, â\\x80\\x9cis a school for people with special abilities â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not mad!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMagic?â\\x80\\x9d he repeated in a whisper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s. . . itâ\\x80\\x99s magic, what I can do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it that you can do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll sorts,â\\x80\\x9d breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. â\\x80\\x9cI can make filings move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew I was different,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered to his own quivering fingers. â\\x80\\x9cI knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you were quite right,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. â\\x80\\x9cYou are a wizard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you a wizard too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I am.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProve it,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, â\\x80\\x9cTell the truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. â\\x80\\x9cIf, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwartsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I am!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you will address me as â\\x80\\x98Professorâ\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x99sir.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddleâ\\x80\\x99s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, sir. I meant â\\x80\\x94 please, Professor, could you show me â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.\\n\\nThe wardrobe burst into flames.\\n\\nRiddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.\\n\\nRiddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. â\\x80\\x9cWhere can I get one of them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll in good time,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOpen the door,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nRiddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTake it out,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nRiddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there anything in that box that you ought not to have?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore.\\n\\nRiddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I suppose so, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he said finally, in an expressionless voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOpen it,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nRiddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yoyo, a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will return them to their owners with your apologies,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. â\\x80\\x9cI shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore went on, â\\x80\\x9cwe teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have â\\x80\\x94 inadvertently, I am sure â\\x80\\x94 been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic â\\x80\\x94 yes, there is a Ministry â\\x80\\x94 will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle again.\\n\\nIt was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t got any money.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is easily remedied,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, drawing a leather moneypouch from his pocket. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere do you buy spellbooks?â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Diagon Alley,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI have your list of books and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re coming with me?â\\x80\\x9d asked Riddle, looking up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, if you â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t need you,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley â\\x80\\x94 sir?â\\x80\\x9d he added, catching Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s eye.\\n\\nHarry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, â\\x80\\x9cYou will be able to see it, although Muggles around you â\\x80\\x94 nonmagical people, that is â\\x80\\x94 will not. Ask for Tom the barman â\\x80\\x94 easy enough to remember, as he shares your name â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou dislike the name â\\x80\\x98Tomâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are a lot of Toms,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, â\\x80\\x9cWas my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve told me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy mother canâ\\x80\\x99t have been magic, or she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have died,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cIt mustâ\\x80\\x99ve been him. So â\\x80\\x94 when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got all my stuffâ\\x80\\x94 when do I come to this Hogwarts?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cYou will leave from Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, â\\x80\\x9cI can speak to snakes. I found out when weâ\\x80\\x99ve been to the country on trips â\\x80\\x94 they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is unusual,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation, â\\x80\\x9cbut not unheard of.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodbye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that will do,â\\x80\\x9d said the whitehaired Dumbledore at Harryâ\\x80\\x99s side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the presentday office.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSit down,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.\\n\\nHarry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe believed it much quicker than I did â\\x80\\x94 I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was â\\x80\\x94 to use his word â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x99special,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you know â\\x80\\x94 then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cNo, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for othersâ\\x80\\x99 sake as much as his.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis powers, as you heard, were surprisingly welldeveloped for such a young wizard and â\\x80\\x94 most interestingly and ominously of all â\\x80\\x94 he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . . â\\x80\\x98I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd he was a Parselmouth,â\\x80\\x9d interjected Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTime is making fools of us again,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. â\\x80\\x9cBut before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirstly, I hope you noticed Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, â\\x80\\x98Tomâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of â\\x80\\x98Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99 behind which he has been hidden for so long.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly selfsufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd lastly â\\x80\\x94 I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry â\\x80\\x94 the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpielike tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now, it really is time for bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I upon the little table on which Marvolo Gauntâ\\x80\\x99s ring had rested last I time, but the ring was no longer there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe ringâ\\x80\\x99s gone,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, looking around. â\\x80\\x9cBut I thought I you might have the mouth organ or something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his halfw moon spectacles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself to be dismissed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14: Felix Felicis\\n\\n\\nHarry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekendâ\\x80\\x99s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWow, scary thought, the boy YouKnowWho,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. â\\x80\\x9cBut I still donâ\\x80\\x99t get why Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s showing you all this. I mean, itâ\\x80\\x99s really interesting and everything, but whatâ\\x80\\x99s the point?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, inserting a gum shield. â\\x80\\x9cBut he says its all important and itâ\\x80\\x99ll help me survive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99s fascinating,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo how was Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s latest party?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, it was quite fun, really,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because heâ\\x80\\x99s so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGwenog Jones?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. â\\x80\\x9cThe Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cPersonally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite enough chat over here!â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s already got his first pod!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOkay, Professor, weâ\\x80\\x99re starting now!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, â\\x80\\x9cshould ve used Muffliato, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, we shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the HalfBlood Prince and his spells. â\\x80\\x9cWell, come on â\\x80¦ weâ\\x80\\x99d better get going. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.\\n\\nIt sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be having any of these in my garden when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got my own place,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPass me a bowl,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at armâ\\x80\\x99s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be squeamish, squeeze it out, theyâ\\x80\\x99re best when theyâ\\x80\\x99re fresh!â\\x80\\x9d called Professor Sprout.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyway,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, â\\x80\\x9cSlughornâ\\x80\\x99s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, â\\x80\\x9cAnd this is another party just for Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s favorites, is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust for the Slug Club, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nThe pod flew out from under Ronâ\\x80\\x99s fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sproutâ\\x80\\x99s head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, â\\x80\\x9cLook, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t make up the name â\\x80\\x98Slug Clubâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Slug Club,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9drepeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re allowed to bring guests,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, â\\x80\\x9cand I was going to ask you to come, but if you think itâ\\x80\\x99s that stupid then I wonâ\\x80\\x99t bother!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were going to ask me?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron, in a completely different voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione angrily. â\\x80\\x9cBut obviously if youâ\\x80\\x99d rather 1 hooked up with McLaggen â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, in a very quiet voice.\\n\\nHarry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9dReparo,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x98 he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of â\\x80\\x9cFleshEating Trees of the Worldâ\\x80\\x9d to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHand that over, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione hurriedly. â\\x80\\x9cIt says weâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it. â\\x80¦ He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didnâ\\x80\\x99t split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGotcha!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.\\n\\nThe rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what\\n\\nhappened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.\\n\\nKatie Bell was still in St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.\\n\\nHarry did not think he could stand another fullHouse tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you still interested in playing Chaser?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWha â\\x80\\x94 ? Yeah, of course!â\\x80\\x9d said Dean excitedly. Over Deanâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell then, youâ\\x80\\x99re in,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a practice tonight, seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Dean. â\\x80\\x9cCheers, Harry! Blimey, I canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to tell Ginny!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamusâ\\x80\\x99s head as one of Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s canaries whizzed over them.\\n\\nSeamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katieâ\\x80\\x99s substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost. . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. . . .\\n\\nHarry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.\\n\\nHarry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was an accident, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!â\\x80\\x9d Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. â\\x80\\x9cI just â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPanicked,â\\x80\\x9d Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. â\\x80\\x9cYou prat, Ron, look at the state of her!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can fix that,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth, and saying â\\x80\\x9cEpiskey.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd Ginny, donâ\\x80\\x99t call Ron a prat, youâ\\x80\\x99re not the Captain of this team â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry forced himself not to laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the air, everyone, letâ\\x80\\x99s go. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOverall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood work, everyone, I think weâ\\x80\\x99ll flatten Slytherin,â\\x80\\x9d he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI played like a sack of dragon dung,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, you didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry firmly. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.\\n\\nIt was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ronâ\\x80\\x99s voice as though from a great distance away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOi!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. â\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny.\\n\\nDean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Deanâ\\x80\\x99s instant dismissal from the team.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr . . . câ\\x80\\x99mon, Ginny,â\\x80\\x9d said Dean, â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s go back to the common room. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou go!â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cI want a word with my dear brother!â\\x80\\x9d Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYeah, it is!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, just as angrily. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x99 you think I want people saying my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s a â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA what?â\\x80\\x9d shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. â\\x80\\x9cA what, exactly?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean anything, Ginny â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said Harry automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s words. â\\x80\\x9cOh yes he does!â\\x80\\x9d she said, flaring up at Harry. â\\x80\\x9cJust because heâ\\x80\\x99s never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss heâ\\x80\\x99s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShut your mouth!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I will not!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Ginny, beside herself. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping sheâ\\x80\\x99ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, itâ\\x80\\x99s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self, you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind so much that everyone else does it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know what youâ\\x80\\x99re talking about!â\\x80\\x9d Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. â\\x80\\x9cJust because I donâ\\x80\\x99t do it in public â\\x80\\x94 !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGinny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBeen kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?â\\x80\\x9d You â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nA streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be stupid â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarryâ\\x80\\x99s snogged Cho Chang!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, itâ\\x80\\x99s only you who acts like itâ\\x80\\x99s something disgusting, Ron, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s because youâ\\x80\\x99ve got about as much experience as a twelveyearold!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Richâ\\x80\\x99s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke the tension.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCâ\\x80\\x99mon,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, as the sound of Filchâ\\x80\\x99s shuffling feet reached their ears.\\n\\nThey hurried up the stairs and along a seventhfloor corridor. â\\x80\\x9cOi, out of the way!â\\x80\\x9d Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.\\n\\nHarry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just because sheâ\\x80\\x99s Ronâ\\x80\\x99s sister, he told himself. You just didnâ\\x80\\x99t like seeing her kissing Dean because sheâ\\x80\\x99s Ronâ\\x80\\x99s sister. . . .\\n\\nBut unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The monster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like â\\x80\\x9cbetrayal of trustâ\\x80\\x9d . . . â\\x80\\x9csupposed to be my friendâ\\x80\\x9d . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x99you think Hermione did snog Krum?â\\x80\\x9d Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d he said confusedly. â\\x80\\x9cOh â\\x80¦ er â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d The honest answer was â\\x80\\x9cyes,â\\x80\\x9d but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDilligrout,â\\x80\\x9d he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room.\\n\\nNeither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts,\\n\\nHarry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his fourposter and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elderbrotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now. â\\x80¦ It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing herâ\\x80¦ No â\\x80¦ he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .\\n\\nRon gave a great grunting snore.\\n\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s Ronâ\\x80\\x99s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ronâ\\x80\\x99s sister. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s outofbounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.\\n\\nHarry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beaterâ\\x80\\x99s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only coldshouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average BlastEnded Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boysâ\\x80\\x99 dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.\\n\\nTo Harryâ\\x80\\x99s dismay, Ronâ\\x80\\x99s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shut up and leave her alone!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Peakes, who was about twothirds Ronâ\\x80\\x99s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cENOUGH!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ronâ\\x80\\x99s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the BatBogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. â\\x80\\x9cPeakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today, Ron . . .â\\x80\\x9d he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to kick you off the team.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom. all the fight went out of him and he said, â\\x80\\x9cI resign. Iâ\\x80\\x99m pathetic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not pathetic and youâ\\x80\\x99re not resigning!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. â\\x80\\x9cYou can save anything when youâ\\x80\\x99re on form, itâ\\x80\\x99s a mental problem youâ\\x80\\x99ve got!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou calling me mental?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYeah, maybe I am!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. â\\x80\\x9cI know you havenâ\\x80\\x99t got any time to find another Keeper, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, Iâ\\x80\\x99m taking myself off the team.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ronâ\\x80\\x99s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goalsaving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.\\n\\nHarry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . . .\\n\\nIf only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .\\n\\nAnd the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.\\n\\nBreakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.\\n\\nThe Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCheer up, Ron!â\\x80\\x9d called Lavender. â\\x80\\x9cI know youâ\\x80\\x99ll be brilliant!â\\x80\\x9d : Ron ignored her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTea?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked him. â\\x80\\x9cCoffee? Pumpkin juice?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnything,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.\\n\\nA few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow are you both feeling?â\\x80\\x9d she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFine,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. â\\x80\\x9cThere you go, Ron. Drink up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke\\n\\nsharply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t drink that, Ron!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBoth Harry and Ron looked up at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nHermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou just put something in that drink.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ronâ\\x80\\x99s drink. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got the bottle in your hand right now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dont know what youâ\\x80\\x99re talking about,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRon, I warn you, donâ\\x80\\x99t drink it!â\\x80\\x9d Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, â\\x80\\x9cStop bossing me around, Hermione.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, â\\x80\\x9cYou should be expelled for that. Iâ\\x80\\x99d never have believed it of you, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook whoâ\\x80\\x99s talking,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered back. â\\x80\\x9cConfunded anyone lately?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his lips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNearly time/â\\x80\\x99 said Harry blithely.\\n\\nThe frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who was pale and sicklooking.\\n\\nGinny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cConditions look ideal,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, ignoring Ron. â\\x80\\x9cAnd guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey â\\x80\\x94 he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and heâ\\x80\\x99s too sore to play! And even better than that â\\x80\\x94 Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s gone off sick too!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s ill? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong with him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo idea, but itâ\\x80\\x99s great for us,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny brightly. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re playing Harper instead; heâ\\x80\\x99s in my year and heâ\\x80\\x99s an idiot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFishy, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d he said in an undertone to Ron. â\\x80\\x9cMalfoy not playing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLucky, I call it,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking slightly more animated. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Vaisey off too, heâ\\x80\\x99s their best goal scorer, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t fancy â\\x80\\x94 hey!â\\x80\\x9d he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80¦ you . . .â\\x80\\x9d Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. â\\x80\\x9cMy drink â\\x80¦ my pumpkin juice â\\x80¦ you didnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80¦?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll be starting in about five minutes, youâ\\x80\\x99d better get your boots on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegoodâ\\x80\\x99s famous liontopped hat.\\n\\nHarry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCaptains shake hands,â\\x80\\x9d she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. â\\x80\\x9cMount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.\\n\\nHarry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentatorâ\\x80\\x99s started up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, there they go, and I think weâ\\x80\\x99re all surprised to see the team that Potterâ\\x80\\x99s put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThese words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentatorâ\\x80\\x99s podium. A call, skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordanâ\\x80\\x99s; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, and here comes Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s first attempt on goal, itâ\\x80\\x99s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarrys stomach turned over.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 Weasley saves it, well, heâ\\x80\\x99s bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right, Smith, he is,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.\\n\\nWith half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindorâ\\x80\\x99s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, Coote isnâ\\x80\\x99t really the usual build for a Beater,â\\x80\\x9d said Zacharias loftily, â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ve generally got a bit more muscle â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHit a Bludger at him!â\\x80\\x9d Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.\\n\\nIt seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a\\n\\nrousing chorus of the old favorite â\\x80\\x9cWeasley Is Our King,â\\x80\\x9d he pretended to conduct them from on high.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThinks heâ\\x80\\x99s something special today, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. â\\x80\\x9cYour bloodtraitor palâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d Madam Hoochâ\\x80\\x99s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I think Harper of Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s seen the Snitch!â\\x80\\x9d said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. â\\x80\\x9cYes, heâ\\x80\\x99s certainly seen something Potter hasnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSmith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky â\\x80\\x94 Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.\\n\\nHarry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smithâ\\x80\\x99s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost. . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOi, Harper!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry in desperation. â\\x80\\x9cHow much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a doubletake; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYES!â\\x80\\x9d Hairy yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGinny, whereâ\\x80\\x99re you going?â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry, who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of tin1 team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentators podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring,: Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, â\\x80\\x9cForgot to brake, Professor, sorry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLaughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air ami waving to their supporters.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. â\\x80\\x9cParty up in the common room, Seamus said!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Dean exuberantly. â\\x80\\x9cCâ\\x80\\x99mon, Ginny, Demelza!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. â\\x80\\x9cI want a word with you, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d She took a deep breath. â\\x80\\x9cYon shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have done it. You heard Slughorn, its illegal.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you going to do, turn us in?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Ron. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you two talking about?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning, â\\x80\\x9cYou know perfectly well what weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione shrilly. â\\x80\\x9cYou spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Iâ\\x80\\x99elix Felicis!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, turning back to face them both.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes you did, Harry, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t put it in!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. â\\x80\\x9cI wanted Ron to think Iâ\\x80\\x99d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.â\\x80\\x9d He looked at Ron. â\\x80\\x9cYou saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pocketed the potion again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere really wasnâ\\x80\\x99t anything in my pumpkin juice?â\\x80\\x9d Ron said, astounded. â\\x80\\x9cBut the weatherâ\\x80\\x99s good. . . and Vaisey couldnâ\\x80\\x99t play. â\\x80¦ I honestly havenâ\\x80\\x99t been given lucky potion?â\\x80\\x9d ]\\n\\nHarry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. â\\x80\\x9cYou added Felix Felicis to Ronâ\\x80\\x99s juice this morning, thatâ\\x80\\x99s why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never said you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94 Ron, you thought youâ\\x80\\x99d been given it too!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, â\\x80\\x9cshall. . . shall we go up to the party, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou go!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, blinking back tears. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sick of Ron at the moment, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m supposed to have done. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she stormed out of the changing room too.\\n\\nHarry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.\\n\\nHarry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blowbyblow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLooking for Ron?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, smirking. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s over there, the filthy hypocrite.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt looks like heâ\\x80\\x99s eating her face, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny dispassionately. â\\x80\\x9cBut I suppose heâ\\x80\\x99s got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.\\n\\nHarry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.\\n\\nHe darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside , seemed to be deserted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacherâ\\x80\\x99s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, hello, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d she said in a brittle voice. â\\x80\\x9cI was just practicing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah . . . theyâ\\x80\\x99re â\\x80\\x94 er â\\x80\\x94 really good. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nHe had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally highpitched voice, â\\x80\\x9cRon seems to be enjoying the celebrations.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr . . . does he?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t pretend you didnâ\\x80\\x99t see him,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cHe wasnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly hiding it, was â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe door behind them burst open. To Harryâ\\x80\\x99s horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. ; â\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOops!â\\x80\\x9d said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.\\n\\nThere was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, â\\x80\\x9cHi, Harry! Wondered where youâ\\x80\\x99d got to!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t leave Lavender waiting outside,â\\x80\\x9d she said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99ll wonder where youâ\\x80\\x99ve gone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOppugno!â\\x80\\x9d came a shriek from the doorway.\\n\\nHarry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGerremoffme!â\\x80\\x9d he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\\n\\n\\nSnow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harryâ\\x80\\x99s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castleâ\\x80\\x99s secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoefree routes between classes.\\n\\nRon, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.\\n\\nRon, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe canâ\\x80\\x99t complain,â\\x80\\x9d he told Harry. â\\x80\\x9cShe snogged Krum. So sheâ\\x80\\x99s found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, itâ\\x80\\x99s a free country. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t done anything wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never promised Hermione anything , â\\x80\\x9d Ron mumbled. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s Christmas party with her, but she never saidâ\\x80¦ just as friendsâ\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99m a free agentâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ronâ\\x80\\x99s voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words â\\x80\\x9cKrumâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t complainâ\\x80\\x9d again.\\n\\nHermioneâ\\x80\\x99s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. â\\x80\\x9cI really couldnâ\\x80\\x99t care less.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe raised her quill and dotted an â\\x80\\x98iâ\\x80\\x99 so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced PotionMaking and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rinceâ\\x80\\x99s useful additions to Libatius B orageâ\\x80\\x99s text.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd incidentally,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, after a few moments, â\\x80\\x9cyou need to be careful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the last time,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after threequarters of an ho u r of silence, â\\x80\\x9cI am not giving back this book . Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned more from the Halfblood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me inâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not talking about your stupid socalled prince,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m talki ng about earlier. I went into the girlâ\\x80\\x99s bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all hoping theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to get you to take them to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s love potions, which Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid to say probably work â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy didnâ\\x80\\x99t you confiscate them then?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey didnâ\\x80\\x99t have the potions with them in the bathroom,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione scornfully, â\\x80\\x9cThey were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Halfblood princeâ\\x80\\x9d she gave the book another scornful look â\\x80\\x9ccould dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, Iâ\\x80\\x99d just invite someone to go with you, thatâ\\x80\\x99ll stop all the others thinking theyâ\\x80\\x99ve still got a chance. Itâ\\x80\\x99s tomor r ow night, theyâ\\x80\\x99re getting desperate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere isnâ\\x80\\x99t anyone I want to invite,â\\x80\\x9d mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione grimly.\\n\\nShe hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHang on a moment,â\\x80\\x9d he said slowly. â\\x80\\x9cI thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s Wizard Wheezes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s part of their Owl order service.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know a lot about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced PotionMaking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,â\\x80\\x9d she said coldly, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t go around putting potions in peopleâ\\x80\\x99s drinksâ\\x80¦ or pretending too eit h er, which is just as badâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, well, never mind that,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cThe point is, Filch is being fooled isnâ\\x80\\x99t he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school â\\x80\\x93?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Harryâ\\x80¦ not that againâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome on, why not?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook , â\\x80\\x9d sighed Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cSecrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, donâ\\x80\\x99t they? Theyâ\\x80\\x99re used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. Theyâ\\x80\\x99d have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something thatâ\\x80\\x99s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn â\\x80\\x98 t register â\\x80\\x94 anyway Love potions arenâ\\x80\\x99t d ark or dangerous -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEasy for you to say,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x93 so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a cough potion, and heâ\\x80\\x99s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nHermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe library is now closed,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cMind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct â\\x80\\x94 what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t the libraryâ\\x80\\x99s, itâ\\x80\\x99s mine!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced PotionMaking off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9d Spoiled!â\\x80\\x9d she hissed . â\\x80\\x9cDesecrated, befouled !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just a book thatâ\\x80\\x99s been written on!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, tugging it out of her grip.\\n\\nShe looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99ll ban you from the library if youâ\\x80\\x99re not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault sheâ\\x80\\x99s barking mad, Hermione. Or dâ\\x80\\x99you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always thought there might be something between themâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ha ha..â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEnjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamplit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBaublesâ\\x80\\x9d said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSame to you,â\\x80\\x9d said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. â\\x80\\x9cFancy a gillywater?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione gave him a â\\x80\\x9cwhatdidItellyou?â\\x80\\x9d look over her shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo thanks,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like it much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, take these anyway,â\\x80\\x9d said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. â\\x80\\x9cChocolate Cauldrons, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t like them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x93 right â\\x80\\x94 thanks a lot.â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who could not think what else to say. â\\x80\\x9d Erâ\\x80\\x93 I â\\x80\\x98 m just going over here with â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTold you,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione succinctly, â\\x80\\x9d Sooner you ask someone, sooner theyâ\\x80\\x99ll all leave you alone and you can â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nBut her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, good night, Harryâ\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, though it was only seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the evening, and she left for the girl sâ\\x80\\x99 dormitory without another word.\\n\\nHarry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behaviorâ\\x80¦\\n\\nBut his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ronâ\\x80\\x99s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ronâ\\x80\\x99s just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her.\\n\\nHe finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girlâ\\x80\\x99s bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, hello, Harry , â\\x80\\x9d said Luna . â\\x80\\x9d D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuffâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe held out her books.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. â\\x80\\x9cThank you , Harry. Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better get goingâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s a bit upset , â\\x80\\x9d said Luna. â\\x80\\x9cI thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasleyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, theyâ\\x80\\x99ve had a row,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe says funny things sometimes, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. â\\x80\\x9cBut he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9d I sâ\\x80\\x99pose , â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. â\\x80\\x9cSo have you had a good term?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s been al l right,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna. â\\x80\\x9d A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me â\\x80\\x98Loonyâ\\x80\\x99 the other day â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow would you like to come to S lughornâ\\x80\\x99s party with me tonight?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe words were out of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.\\n\\nLuna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSlughornâ\\x80\\x99s party? With you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I meanâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. â\\x80\\x9d I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you donâ\\x80\\x99t want toâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was already half hoping that she didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO h no, Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to go with you as friends!â\\x80\\x9d said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. â\\x80\\x9cNobodyâ\\x80\\x99s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x9d said Harry firmly, â\\x80\\x9cThat was a mistake. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So Iâ\\x80\\x99ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock then . â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAHA!â\\x80\\x9d screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPotty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, â\\x80\\x9cPotty loves Loony!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNice to keep these things private,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou couldâ\\x80\\x99ve taken anyone!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in disbelief over dinner. â\\x80\\x9cAnyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t call her that, Ron!â\\x80\\x9d snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m really glad youâ\\x80\\x99re taking her Harry, sheâ\\x80\\x99s so excited.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou could say sorry , â\\x80\\x9d suggested Harry bluntly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?â\\x80\\x9d muttered Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you have to imitate her for?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe laughed at my mustache!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo did I, it was the stupidest thing Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ronâ\\x80\\x99s neck.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x99re you? Youâ\\x80\\x99re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,â\\x80\\x9d said Parvati. â\\x80\\x9cThat Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been anything sinceâ\\x80¦ Oh, hi, Hermione!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nParvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi, Parvati!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. â\\x80\\x9cAre you going to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party tonight?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo invite,â\\x80\\x9d said Parvati gloomily. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d love to go, though, it sounds like itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be really goodâ\\x80¦ Youâ\\x80\\x99re going, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m meeting Cormac at eight, and weâ\\x80\\x99re -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nThere was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c- weâ\\x80\\x99re going up to the party together.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCormac?â\\x80\\x9d said Parvati. â\\x80\\x9cCormac McLaggen, you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione sweetly. â\\x80\\x9cThe one who *almost*â\\x80\\x9d - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - â\\x80\\x9cbec a me Gryffindor Keeper.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you going out with him, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Parvati, wideeyed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh - yes - didnâ\\x80\\x99t you know?â\\x80\\x9d said Harmione, with a most unHermioneish giggle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. â\\x80\\x9cWow , you like your Quidditch players, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? First Krum, then McLaggen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI like *really good* Quidditch players,â\\x80\\x9d Hermione corrected her, still smiling. â\\x80\\x9cWell, see youâ\\x80¦ Got to go and get ready for the partyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\\n\\nWhen he arrived in the entrance hall at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHi,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cShall we get going then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d she said happily. â\\x80\\x9cWhere is the party?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSlughornâ\\x80\\x99s office,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. â\\x80\\x9cDid you hear, thereâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to be a vampire coming?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRufus Scrimgeour?â\\x80\\x9d asked Luna.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI - what?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, disconcerted. â\\x80\\x9cYou mean the Minister of Magic?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, heâ\\x80\\x99s a vampire,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna matteroffactly. â\\x80\\x9cFather wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didnâ\\x80\\x99t want the truth to get out!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took.\\n\\nWhether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office was much larger than the usual teacherâ\\x80\\x99s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of houseelves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, mâ\\x80\\x99boy!â\\x80\\x9d boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. â\\x80\\x9cCome in, come in, so many people Iâ\\x80\\x99d like you to meet!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harryâ\\x80\\x99s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Lunaâ\\x80\\x99s hand and dragged her along with him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of â\\x80\\x98 Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampiresâ\\x80\\x99 - and, of course, his friend Sanguini.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWorple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harryâ\\x80\\x99s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry Potter, I am simply delighted!â\\x80\\x9d said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face. â\\x80\\x9cI was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, â\\x80\\x98Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEr,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cwere you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust as modest as Horace described!â\\x80\\x9d said Worple. â\\x80\\x9cBut seriouslyâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cI would be delighted to write it myselfâ\\x80\\x94 people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or fivehour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you â\\x80\\x94 ask Sanguini here if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t quite â\\x80\\x94 Sanguini, stay here!â\\x80\\x9d added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. â\\x80\\x9cHere, have a pasty,â\\x80\\x9d said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguiniâ\\x80\\x99s hand before turning his attention back to Harry. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m definitely not interested,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry firmly, â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.â\\x80\\x9d He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione! Hermione !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s happened to you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devilâ\\x80\\x99s Snare.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just escaped â\\x80\\x94 I mean, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just left Cormac,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cUnder the mistletoe,â\\x80\\x9d she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cServes you right for coming with him,â\\x80\\x9d he told her severely. â\\x80\\x9cI thought heâ\\x80\\x99d annoy Ron most,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione dispassionately. â\\x80\\x9cI debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou considered Smith?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, revoked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I did, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m starting to wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Letâ\\x80\\x99s go this way, weâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to see him coming, heâ\\x80\\x99s so tall. . . .â\\x80\\x9d The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHello,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood evening, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen you in my classes lately. ..â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got Firenze this year,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. â\\x80\\x9cOr Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no â\\x80¦ we share classes. . . . Itâ\\x80\\x99s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . .â\\x80\\x9d Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry.\\n\\nUnder cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, â\\x80\\x9cLet â\\x80\\x98 s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione raised her eyebrows. â\\x80\\x9cDo you really think Iâ\\x80\\x99d stoop that low?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked at her shrewdly. â\\x80\\x9cHermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a difference,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione with dignity. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry fervently. â\\x80\\x9cBecause heâ\\x80\\x99ll just fall apart again, and weâ\\x80\\x99ll lose the next match â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuidditch!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione angrily. â\\x80\\x9cIs that all boys care about? Cormac hasnâ\\x80\\x99t asked me one single question about myself, no, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been treated to â\\x80\\x98A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggenâ\\x80\\x99 nonstop ever since â\\x80\\x94 oh no, here he comes!â\\x80\\x9d She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeen Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Lunaâ\\x80\\x99s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, hello,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry unenthusiastically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear boy!â\\x80\\x9d she said in a very carrying whisper. â\\x80\\x9cThe rumors! The stories! â\\x80\\x98The Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Sybi l l, we all think our subjectâ\\x80\\x99s most important!â\\x80\\x9d said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t t hink Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever known such a natural at Potions!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. â\\x80\\x9cInstinctive, you know â\\x80\\x94 like his mother! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l â\\x80\\x94 why even Severus â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d And to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. â\\x80\\x9cStop skulking and come and join us, Severus!â\\x80\\x9d hiccuped Slughorn happily. â\\x80\\x9cI was just talking about Harryâ\\x80\\x99s exceptional potionmaking! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTrapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. â\\x80\\x9cFunny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, itâ\\x80\\x99s natural ability!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cYou should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death â\\x80\\x94 never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think even you, Severus â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally?â\\x80\\x9d said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRemind me what other subjects youâ\\x80\\x99re taking, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d asked Slughorn .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDefense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbologyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ,â\\x80\\x9d said Snap e with the faintest sneer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to do,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry defiantly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd a great one youâ\\x80\\x99ll make too!â\\x80\\x9d boomed Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think you should be an Auror, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. â\\x80\\x9cThe Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Slughorn,â\\x80\\x9d wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischiefdetection in his bulging eyes, â\\x80\\x9cI discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMalfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. â\\x80\\x9cAll right, I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t invited!â\\x80\\x9d he said angrily. â\\x80\\x9cI was trying to gate crash, happy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not!â\\x80\\x9d said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re in trouble, you are! Didnâ\\x80\\x99t the headma ster say that nighttime prowling â\\x80\\x98 s out, unless youâ\\x80\\x99ve got permission, didnâ\\x80\\x99t he, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all right, Argus, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s Christmas, and itâ\\x80\\x99s not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, weâ\\x80\\x99ll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco.\\n\\nFil ichâ\\x80\\x99s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? â\\x80¦ a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s face was smoothly inscrutable again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing, nothing,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, waving away Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s t hanks. â\\x80\\x9cI did know your grandfather, after allâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe always spoke very highly of you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy quickly. â\\x80\\x9cSaid you were the best potionmaker heâ\\x80\\x99d ever known. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared at Malfoy. It was not the suckingup that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like a word with you, Draco,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape suddenly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow , Severus,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, hiccuping again, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s Christ mas, do nâ\\x80\\x99t be too hard â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape curtly. â\\x80\\x9cFollow me, Draco.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be back in a bit, Luna â\\x80\\x94 er â\\x80\\x94 bathroom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right,â\\x80\\x9d she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons â\\x80¦ or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9d . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t have anything to do with it, all right?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho suspects me?â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy angrily. â\\x80\\x9cFor the last time, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t do it, okay? That Bell girl must â\\x80\\x98 ve had an enemy no on e knows about â\\x80\\x94 donâ\\x80\\x99t look at me like that! I know what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not stupid, but it wonâ\\x80\\x99t work â\\x80\\x94 I can stop you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a pause and then Snape said quietly, â\\x80\\x9cAh . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just donâ\\x80\\x99t want you butting in !â\\x80\\x9d Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this â\\x80\\x94 Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d jeered Malfoy.\\n\\nThere was another pause. Then Snape said, â\\x80\\x9cYou know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better stop telling me to come to your office then!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. â\\x80\\x9cI am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLooks like youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to break it, then, because I donâ\\x80\\x99t need your protection! Itâ\\x80\\x99s my job, he gave it to me and Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing it, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a plan and itâ\\x80\\x99s going to work, itâ\\x80\\x99s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is your plan ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s none of your business !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9d If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have all the assistance I need, thanks, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not alone!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t put them in detention!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeep your voice down!â\\x80\\x9d spat Snape, for Malfoy â\\x80\\x98 s voice had risen excitedly. â\\x80\\x9cIf your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat does it matter?â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cDefense Against the Dark Arts â\\x80\\x94 its all just a joke, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cWhere do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not the only ones, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got other people on my side, better people!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why not confide in me, and I can â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know what youâ\\x80\\x99re up to! You want to steal my glory!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was another pause, then Snape said coldly, â\\x80\\x9cYou are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had barely a second â\\x80\\x98 s warning; he heard Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16: AVeryFrosty Christmas\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you ask. that once more,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to stick this sprout â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m only checking!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrowâ\\x80\\x99s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Snape was offering to help him!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHe said heâ\\x80\\x99d promised Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s mother to protect him, that heâ\\x80\\x99d made an Unbreakable Oath or something â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn Unbreakable Vow?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking stunned. â\\x80\\x9cNah, he canâ\\x80\\x99t have. . . . Are you sure?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWhy, what does it mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you canâ\\x80\\x99t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou die,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron simply. â\\x80\\x9cFred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cOnly time Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, well, passing over Fredâ\\x80\\x99s left buttock â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon?â\\x80\\x9d said Fredâ\\x80\\x99s voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAaah, George, look at this. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re using knives and everything. Bless them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be seventeen in two and a bit monthsâ\\x80\\x99 time,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron grumpily, â\\x80\\x9cand then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to do it by magic!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut meanwhile,â\\x80\\x9d said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, â\\x80\\x9cwe can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a â\\x80\\x94 whoopsadaisy!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou made me do that!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. â\\x80\\x9cYou wait, when Iâ\\x80\\x99m seventeen â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure youâ\\x80\\x99ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,â\\x80\\x9d yawned Fred.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,â\\x80\\x9d said George, â\\x80\\x9cwhat is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called â\\x80\\x94 unless our information is faulty â\\x80\\x94 Lavender Brown?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. â\\x80\\x9cMind your own business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a snappy retort,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred. â\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know wasâ\\x80¦ how did it happen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat dâ\\x80\\x99you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid she have an accident or something?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d ..Â¦;\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRon!â\\x80\\x9d she said furiously. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wont,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, â\\x80\\x9clet you see,â\\x80\\x9d he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFred, George, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.â\\x80\\x9d ;\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo problem,â\\x80\\x9d said George.\\n\\n- â\\x80\\x9cThen, as Charlie isnâ\\x80\\x99t coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;Â¦/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99ll make Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s Christmas â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d muttered Fred. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 everyone should be comfortable. Well, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll have a bed, anyway,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPercy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. â\\x80\\x9cNo, heâ\\x80\\x99s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr heâ\\x80\\x99s the worldâ\\x80\\x99s biggest prat,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. â\\x80\\x9cOne of the two. â\\x80\\x9cWell, letâ\\x80\\x99s get going, then, George.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you two up to?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron. â\\x80\\x9cCant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll be free\\n\\ntoo!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think we can do that,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred seriously. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very characterbuilding stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 and if you want people to help you, Ron,â\\x80\\x9d added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, â\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. Weâ\\x80\\x99re off to the village, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . , almost like real magic. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGits,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. â\\x80\\x9cWouldâ\\x80\\x99ve only taken them ten seconds and then we couldâ\\x80\\x99ve gone too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI promised Dumbledore I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wander off while Iâ\\x80\\x99m staying here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, â\\x80\\x9cAre you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYep,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPity you didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s actually doing, though.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98Course, you know what theyâ\\x80\\x99ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll say Snape isnâ\\x80\\x99t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s up to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear him,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry flatly. â\\x80\\x9cNo oneâ\\x80\\x99s that good an actor, not even Snape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah . . . Iâ\\x80\\x99m just saying, though/â\\x80\\x99 said Ron.\\n\\nHarry turned to face him, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cYou think Iâ\\x80\\x99m right, though?â\\x80\\x9d ,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I do!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron hastily. â\\x80\\x9cSeriously, I do! But theyâ\\x80\\x99re all convinced Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s in the Order, arenâ\\x80\\x99t they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what heâ\\x80\\x99s doing. . . .\\n\\nThis was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal goodbye just behind him at the time.\\n\\nStill, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying â\\x80\\x9cI told you so,â\\x80\\x9d which he had done several times to Ron already.\\n\\nHarry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paperchain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\\n\\nThey were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called â\\x80\\x9cA Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,â\\x80\\x9d Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more raggedlooking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.\\n\\nOh, come and stir my cauldron,\\n\\nAnd if you do it right,\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll boil you up some hot strong love\\n\\nTo keep you warm tonight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe danced to this when we were eighteen!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. â\\x80\\x9cDo you remember, Arthur?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMphf?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. â\\x80\\x9cOh yes â\\x80¦ marvelous tune . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry about this,â\\x80\\x9d he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. â\\x80\\x9cBe over soon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo problem,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, grinning. â\\x80\\x9cHas it been busy at the Ministry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests weâ\\x80\\x99ve made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater â\\x80\\x94 only donâ\\x80\\x99t repeat that, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid so,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cI know Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. â\\x80¦ I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that heâ\\x80\\x99s about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though theyâ\\x80\\x99re making some progress, and â\\x80\\x98three arrestsâ\\x80\\x99 sounds better than â\\x80\\x98three mistaken arrests and releasesâ\\x80\\x99. . . but again, this is\\n\\nall top secret. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t say anything,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called â\\x80\\x9cYou Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI checked, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley at once. â\\x80\\x9cI went and searched the Malfoysâ\\x80\\x99 house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that youâ\\x80\\x99d looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between\\n\\nMalfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupinâ\\x80\\x99s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestinaâ\\x80\\x99s crooning.\\n\\nOh, my poor heart, where has it gone? Itâ\\x80\\x99s left me for a spellâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas it occurred to you, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, â\\x80\\x9cthat Snape was simply pretending â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s up to?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cYeah, I thought youâ\\x80\\x99d say that. But how do we know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t our business to know,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cjust say â\\x80\\x94 just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Dumbledore can make mistakes,â\\x80\\x9d argued Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHe says it himself. And youâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 he looked Lupin straight in the eye â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cdo you honestly like Snape?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI neither like nor dislike Severus,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cNo, Harry, I am speaking the truth,â\\x80\\x9d he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he â\\x80\\x98accidentallyâ\\x80\\x99 let it slip that youâ\\x80\\x99re a werewolf, so you had to leave!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily.\\n\\nLupin shrugged. â\\x80\\x9cThe news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe he didnâ\\x80\\x99t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are determined to hate him, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin with a faint smile. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s orders that Severus questioned Draco.â\\x80\\x9d ;\\n\\n. . . and now youâ\\x80\\x99ve torn it quite apart Iâ\\x80\\x99ll thank you to give back my heart!\\n\\nCelestina ended her song on a very long, highpitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEez eet over?â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur loudly. â\\x80\\x9cThank goodness, what an â\\x80\\x98orrible â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall we have a nightcap, then?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. â\\x80\\x9cWho wants eggnog?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you been up to lately?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been underground,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cAlmost literally. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.â\\x80\\x9d -:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been living among my fellows, my equals,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cWerewolves,â\\x80\\x9d he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. â\\x80\\x9cNearly all of them are on Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . readymade.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, â\\x80\\x9cI am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing â\\x80\\x94 and sometimes killing â\\x80\\x94 to eat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow come they like Voldemort?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cAnd it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s Greyback?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t heard of him?â\\x80\\x9d Lupinâ\\x80\\x99s hands closed convulsively in his lap. â\\x80\\x9cFenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon peopleâ\\x80\\x99s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLupin paused and then said, â\\x80\\x9cIt was Greyback who bit me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, astonished. â\\x80\\x9cWhen â\\x80\\x94 when you were a kid, you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greybackâ\\x80\\x99s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut you are normal!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry fiercely. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve just got a â\\x80\\x94 a\\n\\nproblem â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLupin burst out laughing. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my â\\x80\\x98furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved\\n\\nrabbit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you ever heard of someone called the HalfBlood Prince?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe HalfBlood what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrince,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are no Wizarding princes,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin, now smiling. â\\x80\\x9cIs this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 would be enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to do with me!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry indignantly. â\\x80\\x9cThe HalfBlood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin reminiscently. â\\x80\\x9cThere were a few months in my fifth year when you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dad used it,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cbut he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,â\\x80\\x9d Harry persisted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot necessarily,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cJinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face and then said quietly, â\\x80\\x9cJames was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him â\\x80\\x98Prince.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAbandoning pretense, Harry said, â\\x80\\x9cAnd it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t Sirius? Or you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDefinitely not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh.â\\x80\\x9d Harry stared into the fire. â\\x80\\x9cI just thought â\\x80\\x94 well, heâ\\x80\\x99s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow old is this book, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never checked.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin.\\n\\nShortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing â\\x80\\x9cA Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,â\\x80\\x9d which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ronâ\\x80\\x99s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\\n\\nRon fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced PotionMaking before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the HalfBlood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s got to be joking. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s chat?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry. â\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIts from Lavender,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, sounding revolted^ â\\x80\\x9cShe earn\\n\\nhonestly think Iâ\\x80\\x99d wear â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan\\n\\ngling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy sweetheartâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNice,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cClassy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you tell them,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, â\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 I â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStutter at me?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, grinning. â\\x80\\x9cCome on, would I?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow could she think Iâ\\x80\\x99d like something like that, though?â\\x80\\x9d Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, think back,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHave you ever let it slip that youâ\\x80\\x99d like to go out in public with the words â\\x80\\x98My Sweetheartâ\\x80\\x99 round your neck?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80¦ we donâ\\x80\\x99t really talk much,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s mainly . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnogging,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, â\\x80\\x9cIs Hermione really going out with McLaggen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cThey were at Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s party together, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it went that well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\\n\\nHarrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, handknitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldysmelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher,\\n\\nHarry stared at it. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x99you reckon this is safe to open?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t be anything dangerous, all our mailâ\\x80\\x99s still being searched at the Ministry,â\\x80\\x9d replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their houseelves Christmas presents?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHermione would,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cBut letâ\\x80\\x99s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. â\\x80\\x9cNice,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, roaring with laughter. â\\x80\\x9cVery thoughtful.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather have them than that necklace,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\\n\\nEverybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brandnew midnight blue witchâ\\x80\\x99s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFred and George gave them to me! Arenâ\\x80\\x99t they beautiful?â\\x80\\x9d .: â\\x80\\x9cWell, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now weâ\\x80\\x99re washing our own socks,â\\x80\\x9d said George, waving an airy hand. â\\x80\\x9cParsnips, Remus?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a maggot in your hair,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ow â\\x80\\x98orrible,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cGravy, Fleur?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are as bad as zat Tonks,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. â\\x80\\x9cShe is always knocking â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI invited dear Tonks to come along today,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. â\\x80\\x9cBut she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been in contact with anybody very much,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cBut Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmmm,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughterinlaw instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a longlost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTonksâ\\x80\\x99s Patronus has changed its form,â\\x80\\x9d he told him. â\\x80\\x9cSnape said so anyway. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, â\\x80\\x9cSometimes â\\x80¦ a great shock â\\x80¦ an emotional upheaval â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt looked big, and it had four legs,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. â\\x80\\x9cHey â\\x80¦ it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArthur!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. â\\x80\\x9cArthur â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s Percy!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his hornrimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArthur, heâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94 heâ\\x80\\x99s with the Minister!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percyâ\\x80\\x99s wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\\n\\nThere was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, â\\x80\\x9cMerry Christmas, Mother.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Percy!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\\n\\nRufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must forgive this intrusion,â\\x80\\x9d he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. â\\x80\\x9cPercy and I were in the vicinity â\\x80\\x94 working, you know â\\x80\\x94 and he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t resist dropping in and seeing you all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, pokerstraight and awkwardlooking, and stared over everybody elseâ\\x80\\x99s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stonyfaced.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease, come in, sit down, Minister!â\\x80\\x9d fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. â\\x80¦ 1 â\\x80\\x98. mean â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, my dear Molly,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to intrude, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be here at all if Percy hadnâ\\x80\\x99t wanted to see you all so badly. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Perce!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. , . Weâ\\x80\\x99ve only looked in for five minutes, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young manâ\\x80\\x99s finished, why doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he take a stroll with me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeourâ\\x80\\x99s pretense that he did not know Harryâ\\x80\\x99s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, all right,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry into the silence.\\n\\nHe was not fooled; for all Scrimgeourâ\\x80\\x99s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s fine,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. â\\x80\\x9cFine,â\\x80\\x9d he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonderful!â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass\\n\\nthrough the door ahead of him. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be off. Carry on, everyone!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry walked across the yard toward the Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 overgrown, snowcovered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battlescarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCharming,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. â\\x80\\x9cCharming.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. â\\x80\\x9cDid you know that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry truthfully. Â¦!.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x9cNatural, of course, natural, after what youâ\\x80\\x99ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d:\\n\\nHe waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, â\\x80\\x9cI have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has â\\x80\\x94 most understandably, as I say â\\x80\\x94 prevented this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStill, Harry said nothing, waiting.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe rumors that have flown around!â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x9cWell, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted â\\x80¦ all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99. . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?â\\x80\\x9d,\\n\\nHarry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffedup patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth â\\x80¦ or a bit of it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, weâ\\x80\\x99ve discussed it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you, have you . . .â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. â\\x80\\x9cAnd what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s between us,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeourâ\\x80\\x99s tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, â\\x80\\x9cOh, of course, if itâ\\x80\\x99s a question of confidences, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want you to divulge . . . no, no â\\x80¦ and in any case, does it really matter whether you are â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t really know what you mean, Minister.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, of course, to you it will matter enormously,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour with a laugh. â\\x80\\x9cBut to the Wizarding community at large . . . itâ\\x80\\x99s all perception, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Itâ\\x80\\x99s what people believe thatâ\\x80\\x99s important.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople believe you are â\\x80\\x98the Chosen One,â\\x80\\x99 you see,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x9cThey think you quite the hero â\\x80\\x94 which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced HeWhoMustNotBeNamed now? Well, anyway,â\\x80\\x9d he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, â\\x80\\x9cthe point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy HeWhoMustNotBeNamed â\\x80\\x94 well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I canâ\\x80\\x99t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, â\\x80\\x9cFunny little chaps, arenâ\\x80\\x99t they? But what say you, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t exactly understand what you want,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry slowly. â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9dStand alongside the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99 . . . What does that mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x9cIf you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo basically,â\\x80\\x9d he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99d like to give the impression that Iâ\\x80\\x99m working for the Ministry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The Chosen One,â\\x80\\x99 you know. . . Itâ\\x80\\x99s all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, â\\x80\\x9cwonâ\\x80\\x99t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s up to?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, â\\x80\\x9cwell, yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s partly why weâ\\x80\\x99d like â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think thatâ\\x80\\x99ll work,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry pleasantly. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, I donâ\\x80\\x99t like some of the things the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nScrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. â\\x80\\x9cI would not expect you to understand,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. â\\x80\\x9cThese are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, â\\x80\\x9cI see. You prefer â\\x80\\x94 like your hero, Dumbledore â\\x80\\x94 to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be used,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome would say itâ\\x80\\x99s your duty to be used by the Ministry!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, his temper rising now. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re doing what Barty Crouch\\n\\ndid. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either weâ\\x80\\x99ve got Fudge, pretending everythingâ\\x80\\x99s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or weâ\\x80\\x99ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend youâ\\x80\\x99ve got â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 working for you!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98 i\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo youâ\\x80\\x99re not â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour. â\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you said it didnâ\\x80\\x99t matter either way?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, with a bitter laugh. â\\x80\\x9cNot to you anyway.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have said that,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour quickly. â\\x80\\x9cIt was tactless â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it was honest,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cOne of the only honest things youâ\\x80\\x99ve said to me. You donâ\\x80\\x99t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone youâ\\x80\\x99re winning the war against Voldemort. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t forgotten, Ministerâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasnâ\\x80\\x99t so keen to be pals last year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is Dumbledore up to?â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour brusquely. â\\x80\\x9cWhere does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo idea,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell me if you knew,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, â\\x80\\x9cwould you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, 1 wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, I shall have to see whether I canâ\\x80\\x99t find out by other means.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can try,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry indifferently. â\\x80\\x9cBut you seem cleverer than Fudge, so Iâ\\x80\\x99d have thought youâ\\x80\\x99d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed heâ\\x80\\x99s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s still headmaster. Iâ\\x80\\x99d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a long pause.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,â\\x80\\x9d said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wirerimmed glasses, â\\x80\\x9cDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s man through and through, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I am,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cGlad we straightened that out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17: A Sluggish Memory\\n\\n\\nLate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this oneoff connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say goodbye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit).\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t cry, Mum,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s okay. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, donâ\\x80\\x99t worry about us,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, â\\x80\\x9cor about Percy. Heâ\\x80\\x99s such a prat, itâ\\x80\\x99s not really a loss, is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPromise me youâ\\x80\\x99ll look after yourself.. .. Stay out of trouble. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI always do, Mrs. Weasley,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI like a quiet life, you know me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe gave a watery chuckle and stood back. â\\x80\\x9cBe good, then, all of you. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted â\\x80\\x9cHogwarts!â\\x80\\x9d He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 kitchen and Mrs. Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagallâ\\x80\\x99s office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Professor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagallâ\\x80\\x99s office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBaubles,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat dâ\\x80\\x99you mean, â\\x80\\x98noâ\\x80\\x99 ?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a new password,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd please donâ\\x80\\x99t shout.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut weâ\\x80\\x99ve been away, howâ\\x80\\x99re we supposed to â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry! Ginny!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione was hurrying toward them, very pinkfaced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI got back a couple of hours ago, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck â\\x80\\x94 I mean Witherwings,â\\x80\\x9d she said breathlessly. â\\x80\\x9cDid you have a good Christmas?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron at once, â\\x80\\x9cpretty eventful, Rufus Scrim â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d ] â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got something for you, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. â\\x80\\x9cOh, hang on â\\x80\\x94 password. Abstinence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely,â\\x80\\x9d said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up with her?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOverindulged over Christmas, apparently,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. â\\x80\\x9cShe and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anywayâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s writing on it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGreat,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got loads to tell him â\\x80\\x94 and you. Letâ\\x80\\x99s sit down â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut at that moment there was a loud squeal of â\\x80\\x9cWonWon!â\\x80\\x9d and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ronâ\\x80\\x99s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a cable over hereâ\\x80¦ Coming. Ginny?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, thanks, I said Iâ\\x80\\x99d meet Dean,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling, match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo how was your Christmas?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, fine,â\\x80\\x9d she shrugged. â\\x80\\x9cNothing special. How was it at WonWonâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you in a minute,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cLook, Hermione, canâ\\x80\\x99t you â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I canâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d she said flatly. â\\x80\\x9cSo donâ\\x80\\x99t even ask.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought maybe, you know, over Christmas â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of fivehundredyearold wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you think â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what heâ\\x80\\x99s doing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRonâ\\x80\\x99s dad and Lupin think so,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said grudgingly. â\\x80\\x9cBut this definitely proves Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s planning something, you canâ\\x80\\x99t deny that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I canâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d she answered slowly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd heâ\\x80\\x99s acting on Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s orders, just like I said!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmm .. . did either of them actually mention Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s name?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry frowned, trying to remember. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure â\\x80¦ Snape definitely said â\\x80\\x98your master,â\\x80\\x99 and who else would that be?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, biting her lip. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe his father?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. â\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x99s Lupin?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot great,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and he told her all about Lupinâ\\x80\\x99s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. â\\x80\\x9cHave you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, sounding startled. â\\x80\\x9cAnd so have you, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, not History of Magic â\\x80\\x94 Malfoy threatened Borgin with Kim!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cBack in Knockturn Alley, donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that heâ\\x80\\x99d be checking up on Borginâ\\x80\\x99s progress!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry gaped at her. â\\x80\\x9cI forgot! But this proves Malfoy s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is pretty suspicious,â\\x80\\x9d breathed Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cUnless . . .â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh, come on,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in exasperation, â\\x80\\x9cyou canâ\\x80\\x99t get round this one!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re unbelievable, you are,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, shaking his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll see whoâ\\x80\\x99s right. . . . Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, 1 had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.\\n\\nThe new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.\\n\\nAPPARITION LESSONS\\n\\nIf you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelveweek course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.\\n\\nHarry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, â\\x80\\x9cGuess who, WonWon?â\\x80\\x9d Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo â\\x80\\x94 Apparition,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. â\\x80\\x9cShould be a laugh, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe itâ\\x80\\x99s better when you do it yourself, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI forgot youâ\\x80\\x99d already done it. â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99d better pass my test first\\n\\ntime,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking anxious. â\\x80\\x9cFred and George did,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCharlie failed, though, didnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYeah, but Charlieâ\\x80\\x99s bigger than meâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cso Fred and George\\n\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhen can we take the actual test?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSoon as weâ\\x80\\x99re seventeen. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only March for me!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYeah, but you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming , lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow cool will it be when we can just â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance. â\\x80\\x9cMe cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back. . . Heâ\\x80\\x99ll never have another peaceful moment. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of todayâ\\x80\\x99s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarryâ\\x80\\x99s already Apparated,â\\x80\\x9d Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: â\\x80\\x9cI am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDum â\\x80\\x94 er â\\x80\\x94 someone took him. SideAlongApparition, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoa!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore.\\n\\nThe lamps in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burntlooking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s not very happy with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d sighed Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry grinned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s doing a wonderful job.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledore smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your\\n\\nsupport â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter everything Fudge did last year?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily. â\\x80\\x9cAfter Umbridge ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left: office. Within hours of Scrimgeourâ\\x80\\x99s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo thatâ\\x80\\x99s why you argued!â\\x80\\x9d Harry blurted out. â\\x80\\x9cIt was in the Daily Prophetâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cif only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe accused me of being â\\x80\\x98Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s man through and through.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow very rude of him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told him I was.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harryâ\\x80\\x99s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized\\n\\nthat Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, ami stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very touched, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cScrimgeour wanted to know where you go when youâ\\x80\\x99re not at Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he is very nosy about that,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. â\\x80\\x9cHe has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo they still donâ\\x80\\x99t know where you go?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his halfmoon spectacles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they donâ\\x80\\x99t, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless thereâ\\x80\\x99s anything else â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThere is, actually, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s about Malfoy and Snape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Snape, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party . . . well, I followed them, actually. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore listened to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, â\\x80\\x9cThank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot of great importance?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Harry incredulously. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor, did you understand â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, a little sharply. â\\x80\\x9cI think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have conlided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, â\\x80\\x9cyou definitely still trust â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. â\\x80\\x9cMy answer has not changed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should think not,â\\x80\\x9d said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mind, Dumbledore shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think what youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to say is unimportant, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry stiffly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you are quite right, because it is not,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore briskly. â\\x80\\x9cI have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, 1 think, the most important I have collected.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, â\\x80\\x9cwe meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,â\\x80\\x9d continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. â\\x80\\x9cHow soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know â\\x80\\x94 perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of selfimportance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very goodlooking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed police, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t you tell them, sir, what heâ\\x80\\x99d been like when you met him at the orphanage?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you didnâ\\x80\\x99t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, â\\x80\\x98Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. â\\x80\\x9cFew who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThose whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised motherâ\\x80\\x99s family â\\x80\\x94 the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll he had to go upon was the single name â\\x80\\x98Marvolo,â\\x80\\x99 which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his motherâ\\x80\\x99s fatherâ\\x80\\x99s name. Finally, after painstaking research, through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d :\\n\\nDumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was very lucky to collect this,â\\x80\\x9d he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. â\\x80\\x9cAs you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.\\n\\nIt took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gauntsâ\\x80\\x99 house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But\\n\\nthen there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.\\n\\nThe door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an oldfashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, darkhaired, and handsome â\\x80\\x94 the teenage Voldemort.\\n\\nVoldemortâ\\x80\\x99s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYOU!â\\x80\\x9d he bellowed. â\\x80\\x9cYOU!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou speak it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I speak it,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s complete lack of fear. His race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is Marvolo?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDead,â\\x80\\x9d said the other. â\\x80\\x9cDied years ago, didnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle frowned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho are you, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m Morfin, ainâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarvoloâ\\x80\\x99s son?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Course I am, thenâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80¢ ,, .\\n\\nMorfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s blackstoned ring on his right hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you was that Muggle,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Morfin. â\\x80\\x9cYou look mighty like that Muggle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat Muggle?â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle sharply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way,â\\x80\\x9d said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. â\\x80\\x9cYou look right like him. Riddle. But heâ\\x80\\x99s older now, in â\\x80\\x98e? Heâ\\x80\\x99s olderâ\\x80\\x99n you, now I think on it. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMorfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support. â\\x80\\x9cHe come back, see,â\\x80\\x9d he added stupidly.\\n\\nVoldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, â\\x80\\x9cRiddle came back?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAr, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!â\\x80\\x9d said Morfin, spitting on the floor again. â\\x80\\x9cRobbed us, mind, before she ran off. , Whereâ\\x80\\x99s the locket, eh, whereâ\\x80\\x99s Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s locket?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, â\\x80\\x9cDishonored us, , she did, that little slut! And whore you, coming here and asking questions about all that? Itâ\\x80\\x99s over, innit. . . . Itâ\\x80\\x99s over. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s lamp and Morfinâ\\x80\\x99s candle, extinguishing everything. . . . Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s fingers closed tightly around Harryâ\\x80\\x99s arm and they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office seemed to dazzle Harryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that all?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did it go dark, what happened?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. â\\x80\\x9cWhen he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s ring had gone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMeanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avadu Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s scar. â\\x80\\x9cThe Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizardâ\\x80\\x99s murder. They also knew that a convicted Mugglehater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Mugglehater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.\\n\\nAll that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99ll kill me for losing it,â\\x80\\x99 he told his captors over and over again. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99ll kill me for losing his ring.â\\x80\\x99 And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Voldemort stole Morfinâ\\x80\\x99s wand and used it?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, sitting up straight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWe have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to â\\x80\\x98the big house over the way.â\\x80\\x99 There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncleâ\\x80\\x99s mind, laid Morfinâ\\x80\\x99s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Morfin never realized he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t done it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he had this real memory in him all the time!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cand why should anybody delve further into Morfinâ\\x80\\x99s mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfinâ\\x80\\x99s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how come the Ministry didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked angrily â\\x80\\x9cHe was underage at the time, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are quite right â\\x80\\x94 they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDobby,â\\x80\\x9d growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. â\\x80\\x9cSo if youâ\\x80\\x99re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizardâ\\x80\\x99s house, the Ministry wonâ\\x80\\x99t know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face. â\\x80\\x9cThey rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspringâ\\x80\\x99s obedience while within their walls.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s rubbish,â\\x80\\x9d snapped Harry. â\\x80\\x9cLook what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI agree,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWhatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis will not take long,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once.\\n\\nIt was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, strawcolored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleonsized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingeryblond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.\\n\\nHarry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office. Haifa dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their midteens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s goldandblack ring; he had already killed his father.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTom, Tom, if I knew I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugarcovered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. â\\x80\\x9cI must say, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter â\\x80\\x94 thank you fm the pineapple, by the way, youâ\\x80\\x99re quite right, it is my favorite â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nAs several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll go wrong, boy, mark my words. â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nThe fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s desk chimed eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood gracious, is it that time already?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better get going, boys, or weâ\\x80\\x99ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or itâ\\x80\\x99s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook sharp, Tom,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefectâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, I wanted to ask you something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAsk away, then, mâ\\x80\\x99boy, ask awayâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s voice boomed out again, just as it had done before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and donâ\\x80\\x99t let me catch you mentioning them again!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s that,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTime to go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd Harryâ\\x80\\x99s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the\\n\\nrug in front of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s desk.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all there is?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry blankly.\\n\\nDumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs you might have noticed,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, â\\x80\\x9cthat memory has been tampered with.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTampered with?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Harry, sitting back down too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why would he do that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut surely, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t need me â\\x80\\x94 you could use Legilimency â\\x80¦ or Veritaserum. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cHe is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. â\\x80\\x9cGood night, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t expect you to, Phineas,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18: Birthday Surprises\\n\\n\\nThe next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ronâ\\x80\\x99s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.\\n\\nRon thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He loves you,â\\x80\\x99 he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. â\\x80\\x98Wonâ\\x80\\x99t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHermione, however, took a gloomier view.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get it out of him,â\\x80\\x99 she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. â\\x80\\x98Horcruxes â\\x80¦ Horcruxes â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never even heard of them â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You havenâ\\x80\\x99t?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, well, if WonWon thinks that, youâ\\x80\\x99d better do it,â\\x80\\x99 she said, flaring up at once. â\\x80\\x98After all, when has WonWonâ\\x80\\x99s judgement ever been faulty?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hermione, canâ\\x80\\x99t you â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No!â\\x80\\x99 she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankledeep in snow.\\n\\nPotions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99ve you done?â\\x80\\x99 Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s haughty profile.\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalottâ\\x80\\x99s Third Law â\\x80¦ who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHermione recited at top speed: â\\x80\\x98Golpalottâ\\x80\\x99sThirdLaw- statesthattheantidoteforablendedpoisonwillbeequalto- morethanthesumoftheantidotesforeachoftheseparale- components.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Precisely!â\\x80\\x99 beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalottâ\\x80\\x99s Third Law as true â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was going to have to take Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s word for it that Golpalottâ\\x80\\x99s Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potionâ\\x80\\x99s ingredients by Scarpinâ\\x80\\x99s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a\\n\\nof themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon was sitting beside Harry with his mouth halfopen, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced PotionMaking. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ and so,â\\x80\\x99 finished Slughorn, â\\x80\\x98I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and donâ\\x80\\x99t forget your protective gloves!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughornâ\\x80\\x99s desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s a shame that the Prince wonâ\\x80\\x99t be able to help you much with this, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 she said brightly as she straightened up. â\\x80\\x98You have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnnoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughornâ\\x80\\x99s desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You sure the Prince hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got any tips?â\\x80\\x99 Ron muttered to Harry.\\n\\nHarry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced PotionMaking and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalottâ\\x80\\x99s Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Princeâ\\x80\\x99s hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nothing,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry gloomily.\\n\\nHermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, â\\x80\\x98Specialis revelio!â\\x80\\x99 over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.\\n\\nIt took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputation as the best potionmaker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.\\n\\nAnd there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.\\n\\nJust shove a bezoar down their throats.\\n\\nHarry stared at these words for a moment. Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? â\\x80\\x98A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word â\\x80\\x98Bezoarsâ\\x80\\x99.\\n\\nHe opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!â\\x80\\x99 Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like driedup kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Timeâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦ UP!â\\x80\\x99 called Slughorn genially. â\\x80\\x98Well, letâ\\x80\\x99s see how youâ\\x80\\x99ve done! Blaise â\\x80¦ what have you got for me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSlowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.\\n\\nSlughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernieâ\\x80\\x99s potion and passed on to Ronâ\\x80\\x99s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ronâ\\x80\\x99s cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98What have you got to show me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.\\n\\nSlughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a nerve, boy!â\\x80\\x99 he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. â\\x80\\x98Oh, youâ\\x80\\x99re like your mother â\\x80¦ well, 1 canâ\\x80\\x99t fault you â\\x80¦ a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHermione, who was sweatyfaced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her halffinished antidote, comprising fiftytwo ingredients including a chunk of her own hair,\\n\\nbubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?â\\x80\\x99 she asked through gritted teeth.\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s the individual spirit a real potionmaker needs!â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. â\\x80\\x98Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potionmaking, itâ\\x80\\x99s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it â\\x80¦ yes, Harry, yes, if youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick â\\x80¦ although as they donâ\\x80\\x99t work on everything, and are pretty rare, itâ\\x80\\x99s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.\\n\\nTime to pack up!â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x98And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nStill chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.\\n\\nHarry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come on, now, Harry, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be late for your next lesson,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sir,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, â\\x80\\x981 wanted to ask you something.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sir, 1 wondered what you know about â\\x80¦ about Horcruxes?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSlughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, â\\x80\\x98What did you say?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dumbledore put you up to this,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Slughorn.\\n\\nHis voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s shown you that - that memory,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x98Well? Hasnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, of course,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. â\\x80\\x98Of course â\\x80¦ well, if youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that memory, Harry, youâ\\x80\\x99ll know that I donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully â\\x80\\x98- about Horcruxes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe seized his dragonskin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sir,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry desperately, â\\x80\\x98I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Did you?â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn. Then you were wrong, werenâ\\x80\\x99t you? WRONG!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.\\n\\nNeither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadnâ\\x80\\x99t slipped him a bezoar, too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve just looked stupid if weâ\\x80\\x99d both done it!â\\x80\\x99 said Harry irritably. â\\x80\\x98Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I? Oh, will you gel a grip!â\\x80\\x99 he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.\\n\\nInfuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s atti-\\n\\ntudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.\\n\\nWhen Harry did noi question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac tice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I havenâ\\x80\\x99t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!â\\x80\\x9d she told him. â\\x80\\x98Not a single one! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions -nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduciion to Magick Mostc Evilc â\\x80\\x94 listen â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cof the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give directionâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80¦ 1 mean, why mention it, then?â\\x80\\x99 she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. â\\x80\\x98Oh, shut up,â\\x80\\x99 she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. â\\x80\\x98I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dumbledore put you up to this,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Slughorn,\\n\\nHis voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified.

Purplishgrey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixthyearsâ\\x80\\x99 first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.\\n\\nWhen Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good morning,â\\x80\\x99 said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. â\\x80\\x98My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your MinistryApparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!â\\x80\\x99 barked Professor McGonagall.\\n\\nEverybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,â\\x80\\x99 Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione.\\n\\nBut Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how much longer, all right?â\\x80\\x99 Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s taking longer than I thought it would.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nCrabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to secondguess what he was going to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look, itâ\\x80\\x99s none of your business what Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as youâ\\x80\\x99re told and keep a lookout!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98! tell my friends what Iâ\\x80\\x99m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.\\n\\nMalfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, â\\x80\\x98Quiet!â\\x80\\x99 and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front.\\n\\nThank you,â\\x80\\x99 said Twycross. :Now then â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe waved his wand. Oldfashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student.\\n\\nThe important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!â\\x80\\x99 said Twycross. â\\x80\\x98Destination, Determination, Deliberation!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Step one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,â\\x80\\x99 said Twycross. â\\x80\\x98In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nEverybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStep two,â\\x80\\x99 said Twycross, â\\x80\\x98focus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quafflesized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Step three,â\\x80\\x99 called Twycross, â\\x80\\x98and only when 1 give the command â\\x80¦ lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now â\\x80¦ one- 1\\n\\nHarry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.\\n\\nHarry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for.\\n\\n: - THREE!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Never mind, never mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. â\\x80\\x98Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.\\n\\nThe Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sphâ\\x80\\x99nching, or the separation of random body parts,â\\x80\\x99 said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, â\\x80\\x98occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation â\\x80¦ thus.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTwycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. â\\x80\\x98Remember the three Ds,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98and try again â\\x80¦ one -two - three -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut an hour later, Susanâ\\x80\\x99s Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, â\\x80\\x98Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWith that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How did you do?â\\x80\\x99 asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. â\\x80\\x981 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x981 expect your trainers are too small, WonWon,â\\x80\\x99 said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x981 didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel anything,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, ignoring this interruption. â\\x80\\x9cBut 1 donâ\\x80\\x99t care about that now-â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What dâ\\x80\\x99you mean, you donâ\\x80\\x99t care â\\x80¦ donâ\\x80\\x99t you want to leam to Apparate?â\\x80\\x99 said Ron incredulously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not fussed, really. I prefer flying,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. â\\x80\\x98Look, hurry up, will you, thereâ\\x80\\x99s something I want to do â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nPerplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you going to tell me what weâ\\x80\\x99re doing, then?â\\x80\\x99 asked Ron, panting slightly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Up here,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boysâ\\x80\\x99 staircase.\\n\\nTheir dormitory was, as Hamâ\\x80\\x99 had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know â\\x80¦ aha.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I solemn!)â\\x80\\x99 swear that I am up to no good â\\x80¦ or Malfoy is,\\n\\nAt once, the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map appeared on the parchmentâ\\x80\\x99s surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castleâ\\x80\\x99s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castleâ\\x80\\x99s occupants.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Help me find Malfoy,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry urgently.\\n\\nHe laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There!â\\x80\\x99 said Ron, after a minute or so. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s in the Slytherin common room, look â\\x80¦ with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m keeping an eye on him from now on,â\\x80\\x99 he said firmly. â\\x80\\x98And the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, itâ\\x80\\x99ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what heâ\\x80\\x99s-â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.\\n\\nDespite his determination 10 catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.\\n\\nFebruary moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all commonroom noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It was on my birthday!â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98i was looking forward to that!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not a big surprise, though, is it?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Not after what happened to Katie.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had still not returned from Si Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But now all Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!â\\x80\\x99 said Ron grumpily. â\\x80\\x98Big birthday treat â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThree lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as\\n\\never, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of illfeeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Happy birthday, Ron,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. â\\x80\\x98Have a present.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe threw the package across on to Ronâ\\x80\\x99s bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by houseelves in the night.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Cheers,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rummaging in it for the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolledup socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Right,â\\x80\\x99 he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, â\\x80\\x98I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,â\\x80\\x99 so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nice one, Harry!â\\x80\\x99 said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeperâ\\x80\\x99s gloves Harry had given him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No problem,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. â\\x80\\x98Hey â\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99s in his bed â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Seriously good haul this year!â\\x80\\x99 he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. â\\x80\\x98See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come of age next year too â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Cool,â\\x80\\x99 muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast â\\x80¦ he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study â\\x80¦ he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Want one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No thanks,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, looking up. â\\x80\\x98Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s gone again!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Canâ\\x80\\x99t have done,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. â\\x80\\x98Come on. if you donâ\\x80\\x99t hurry up youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to Apparate on an emptystomach â\\x80¦ might make it easier, 1 suppose â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.\\n\\nHarry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, â\\x80\\x98Mischief managed,â\\x80\\x99 though it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ready?â\\x80\\x99 he said to Ron.\\n\\nHe was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rainwashed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ron? Breakfast.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not hungry,â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry stared ai him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I thought you just said -?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n-Well, all right, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come down with you,â\\x80\\x99 sighed Ron, â\\x80\\x98but I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to eat.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry scrutinised him suspiciously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s not that,â\\x80\\x99 Ron sighed again. â\\x80\\x98You â\\x80¦ you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t understand.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Fair enough,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry!â\\x80\\x99 said Ron suddenly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry, I canâ\\x80\\x99t stand it!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You canâ\\x80\\x99t stand what?â\\x80\\x99 asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t stop thinking about her!â\\x80\\x99 said Ron hoarsely.\\n\\nHarry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender â\\x80\\x98LavLavâ\\x80\\x99, he would have to pui his foot down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why does that stop you having breakfast?â\\x80\\x99 Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t think she knows I exist,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron with a desperate gesture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98She definitely knows you exist,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, bewildered. â\\x80\\x98She keeps snogging you, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon blinked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who are you talking about?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWho are you talking about?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Romilda Vane,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, â\\x80\\x98This is a joke, right? Youâ\\x80\\x99re joking.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nT think â\\x80¦ Harry, 1 ihink I love her,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron in a strangled voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98OK,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, â\\x80\\x98OK â\\x80¦ say that again with a straight face.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I love her,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Ron breathlessly. â\\x80\\x98Have you seen her hair, itâ\\x80\\x99s all black and shiny and silky â\\x80¦ and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98This is really funny and everything,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry impatiently, â\\x80\\x98but jokeâ\\x80\\x99s over, all right? Drop it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ronâ\\x80\\x99s fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.\\n\\nHarry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\\\icorpus!\\n\\nRon yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upsidedown, his robes hanging off him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What was that for?â\\x80\\x99 Harry bellowed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!â\\x80\\x99 shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98This is insane!â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s got into -?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd then he saw the box lying open on Ronâ\\x80\\x99s bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They were a birthday present!â\\x80\\x99 shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. â\\x80\\x981 offered you one, didnâ\\x80\\x99t 1?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You just picked them up off the floor, didnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Theyâ\\x80\\x99d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They didnâ\\x80\\x99t fall off your bed, you prat, donâ\\x80\\x99t you understand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and theyâ\\x80\\x99re all spiked with love potion!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Romilda?â\\x80\\x99 he repeated. â\\x80\\x98Did you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off â\\x80¦ but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll introduce you,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, thinking fast. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to let you down now, OK?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be in Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why will she be in there?â\\x80\\x99 asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, inventing wildly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?â\\x80\\x99 said Ron eagerly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Great idea,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re lace, WonWon!â\\x80\\x99 she pouted. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got you a birthday-â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Leave me alone,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron impatiently, â\\x80\\x98Harryâ\\x80\\x99s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.\\n\\nHarry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressinggown and matching nightcap and looking rather blearyeyed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry,â\\x80\\x99 he mumbled. â\\x80\\x98This is very early for a call â\\x80¦ I generally sleep late on a Saturday â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Professor, Iâ\\x80\\x99m really sorry to disturb you,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, â\\x80\\x98but my friend Ronâ\\x80\\x99s swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make him an antidote, could you? Iâ\\x80\\x99d take him to Madam Pomfrey, but weâ\\x80\\x99re not supposed to have anything from Weasleysâ\\x80\\x99 Wizard Wheezes and, you know â\\x80¦ awkward questions â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTd have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?â\\x80\\x99 asked Slughorn. â\\x80\\x98Er,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, â\\x80\\x98well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron mightâ\\x80\\x99ve done something serious -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHelpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, â\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t see her. Harry - is he hiding her?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Was this potion within date?â\\x80\\x99 asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. â\\x80\\x98They can strengthen, you know, the longer theyâ\\x80\\x99re kept.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThat would explain a lot,â\\x80\\x99 panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s his birthday, Professor,â\\x80\\x99 he added imploringly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn, relenting. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got the necessary here in my bag, itâ\\x80\\x99s not a difficult antidote â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon burst through the door into Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, â\\x80\\x98She didnâ\\x80\\x99t see that, did she?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sheâ\\x80\\x99s not here yet,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s good,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron fervently. â\\x80\\x98How do I look?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very handsome,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. â\\x80\\x98Now drink that up, itâ\\x80\\x99s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Brilliant,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.\\n\\nHarry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Back to normal, then?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t mention it, mâ\\x80\\x99boy, donâ\\x80\\x99t mention it,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. â\\x80\\x98Pickmeup, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what he needs,â\\x80\\x99 Slughorn continued, nowbustling over to a table loaded with drinks. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got Butterbeer, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got wine, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got one last bottle of this oakmatured mead â\\x80¦ hmm â\\x80¦ meant to give that to Dumbledore for\\n\\nChristmas â\\x80¦ ah well â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99 he shrugged â\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ he canâ\\x80\\x99t miss what heâ\\x80\\x99s never had! Why donâ\\x80\\x99t we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasleyâ\\x80\\x99s birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood â\\x80¦ perhaps if they got through enough of the oakmatured mead â\\x80¦\\n\\nThere you are, then,â\\x80\\x99 said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. â\\x80\\x98Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- Ron -â\\x80\\x99 whispered Harry.\\n\\nBut Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.\\n\\nThere was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- and may you have many more -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ron!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon had dropped his glass; he halfrose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Professor!â\\x80\\x99 Harry bellowed. â\\x80\\x98Do something]â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What - but -â\\x80\\x99 spluttered Slughorn.\\n\\nHarry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s gargling breath filled the room. Then\\n\\nhe found it - the shrivelled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.\\n\\nHe hurtled back to Ronâ\\x80\\x99s side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19: Elf Tails\\n\\n\\nSo, all in all, not one of Ronâ\\x80\\x99s better birthdays?â\\x80\\x9d said Fred.\\n\\nIt was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ronâ\\x80\\x99s was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis isnâ\\x80\\x99t how we imagined handing over our present,â\\x80\\x9d said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ronâ\\x80\\x99s bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said George.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were in Hogsmeade?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ginny, looking up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were thinking of buying Zonkoâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred gloomily. â\\x80\\x9cA Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good itâ\\x80\\x99ll do us if you lot arenâ\\x80\\x99t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymon â\\x80¦ But never mind that now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ronâ\\x80\\x99s pale face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow exactly did it happen, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon heâ\\x80\\x99ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says heâ\\x80\\x99ll have to stay here a week or so â\\x80¦ keep taking essence of rue . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,â\\x80\\x9d said George in a low voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLucky there was one in the room,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.\\n\\nHermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, whitefaced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened., she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clenchjawed and frightenedlooking, until ai last they had been allowed in to see him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo Mum and Dad know?â\\x80\\x9d Fred asked Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago â\\x80\\x94 theyâ\\x80\\x99re in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office now, but theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be back soon. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo the poison was in the drink?â\\x80\\x9d said Fred quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. â\\x80\\x9cSlughorn poured it out â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould he have been able to slip something into Ronâ\\x80\\x99s glass without you seeing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProbably,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbut why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo idea,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy would Slughorn want to poison Harry?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cI dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred, â\\x80\\x9cbut there must be loads of people whoâ\\x80\\x99d like to poison Harry, mustnâ\\x80\\x99t there? â\\x80\\x98The Chosen Oneâ\\x80\\x99 and all that?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo you think Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s a Death Eater?â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. :,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnythingâ\\x80\\x99s possible,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred darkly. â\\x80\\x9cHe could be under the Imperius Curse,â\\x80\\x9d said George. â\\x80\\x9cOr he could be innocent,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cThe poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99d want to kill Slughorn?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSlughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And . . .â\\x80\\x9d He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cAnd maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you said Slughorn had been planning to give th.u Untie to Dumbledore for Christmas,â\\x80\\x9d Ginny reminded him. â\\x80\\x9cSo the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen the poisoner didnâ\\x80\\x99t know Slughorn very well,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. â\\x80\\x9cAnyone who knew Slughorn would have I known there was a good chance heâ\\x80\\x99d keep something that tasty for himself.â\\x80\\x9d I\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cErmynee,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them\\n\\nThey all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.\\n\\nThe dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair rainflecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphinsized footprints all over the floor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBin in the forest all day!â\\x80\\x9d he panted. â\\x80\\x9cAragogâ\\x80\\x99s worse, I bin readinâ\\x80\\x99 to him â\\x80\\x94 didnâ\\x80\\x99 get up ter dinner till jusâ\\x80\\x99 now anâ\\x80\\x99 then Professor Sprout told me abouâ\\x80\\x99 Ron! How is he?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot bad,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cThey say heâ\\x80\\x99ll be okay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo more than six visitors at a time!â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid makes six,â\\x80\\x9d George pointed out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh . . . yes. ..â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99 believe this,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. â\\x80\\x9cJusâ\\x80\\x99 donâ\\x80\\x99 believe itâ\\x80¦ Look at him lyinâ\\x80\\x99 there. . . . Whoâ\\x80\\x99d want ter hurt him, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s just what we were discussing,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomeone couldnâ\\x80\\x99 have a grudge against the Gryfinndor Quidditch team, could they?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid anxiously. â\\x80\\x9cFirsâ\\x80\\x99 Katie, now Ron . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cant see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,â\\x80\\x9d said\\n\\nI m urge.\\n\\nWood mightâ\\x80\\x99ve done the Slytherins if he couldâ\\x80\\x99ve got away with it,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred fairly.\\n\\nWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s Quidditch, but I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s a connection between the attacks,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione quietly\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow dâ\\x80\\x99you work that out?â\\x80\\x9d asked Fred.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and werenâ\\x80\\x99t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was (supposed to be killed. Of course,â\\x80\\x9d she added broodingly, â\\x80\\x9cthat makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to care how many people they finish off In lore they actually reach their victim.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBefore anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, tin- dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tighty. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s told us how you saved him with the bezoar,â\\x80\\x9d she sobbed. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Harry, what can we say? You saved Ginny . . . you saved Arthur , . . now youâ\\x80\\x99ve saved Ron\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be â\\x80¦ I didnâ\\x80\\x99t. . .â\\x80\\x9d muttered Harry awkwardly. â\\x80\\x9cHalf our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. â\\x80\\x9cWell, all I can say is that it was a lucky clay for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Expirv., Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry could not think of any reply to this and was almost gl.iÂ«l when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ronâ\\x80\\x99s bed; he and Hermione rose .h once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s terrible,â\\x80\\x9d growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three ol them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. â\\x80\\x9cMl this new security, an kids are still gettinâ\\x80\\x99 hurt. . . . Dumbledoivâ\\x80\\x99s worried sick. . . . He don say much, but I can tell. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHasnâ\\x80\\x99t he got any ideas, Hagrid?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione desperately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI spect heâ\\x80\\x99s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cBut he doesnâ\\x80\\x99 know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or theyâ\\x80\\x99dve bin caught, wouldn they? Whaâ\\x80\\x99 worries me,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Peeves), â\\x80\\x9cis how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are beinâ\\x80\\x99 attacked. Chamber oâ\\x80\\x99 Secrets all over again, isnâ\\x80\\x99 it? Thereâ\\x80\\x99ll be panic, more parents takin their kids outta school, an nexâ\\x80\\x99 thing yeh know the board oâ\\x80\\x99 governors â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a longhaired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, â\\x80\\x9c. . . the board oâ\\x80\\x99 governorsâ\\x80\\x99ll be talkin about shuttinâ\\x80\\x99 us up fer good.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely not?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking worried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGotta see it from their point oâ\\x80\\x99 view,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid heavily. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, itâ\\x80\\x99s always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasnâ\\x80\\x99 it? Yer expect accidents, donâ\\x80\\x99 yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, thaâ\\x80\\x99s tliffâ\\x80\\x99rent. â\\x80\\x98Sâ\\x80\\x99no wonder Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s angry with Sn â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s angry with Snape?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never said thaâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. â\\x80\\x9cLook at the time, itâ\\x80\\x99s gettinâ\\x80\\x99 on fer midnight, I need ter â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked loudly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShhhh!â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99 shout stuff like that, Harry, dâ\\x80\\x99yeh wanâ\\x80\\x99 me ter lose me job? Mind, I donâ\\x80\\x99 suppose yehâ\\x80\\x99d care, would yeh, not now yehâ\\x80\\x99ve given up Care of Magâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry forcefully. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s Snape done?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno, Harry, I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99ta heard it at all! I â\\x80\\x94 well, I was cominâ\\x80\\x99 outta the forest the other eveninâ\\x80\\x99 anâ\\x80\\x99 I overheard â\\x80\\x98em talkingâ\\x80\\x94 well, arguinâ\\x80\\x99. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen, but it was a â\\x80\\x94 well, a heated discussion anâ\\x80\\x99 it wasnâ\\x80\\x99 easy ter block it out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell â\\x80\\x94 I jusâ\\x80\\x99 heard Snape sayinâ\\x80\\x99 Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he â\\x80\\x94 Snape â\\x80\\x94 didnâ\\x80\\x99 wanâ\\x80\\x99 ter do it any more â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelinâ\\x80\\x99 a bit overworked, thaâ\\x80\\x99s all â\\x80\\x94 anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out heâ\\x80\\x99d agreed ter do it anâ\\x80\\x99 that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. Anâ\\x80\\x99 then he said summat abouâ\\x80\\x99 Snape makinâ\\x80\\x99 investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothinâ\\x80\\x99 strange abouâ\\x80\\x99 that!â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. â\\x80\\x9cAll the Heads oâ\\x80\\x99 Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, but Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s not having rows with the rest of them, is he?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook,â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. â\\x80\\x9cI know what yehâ\\x80\\x99re like abouâ\\x80\\x99 Snape, Harry, anâ\\x80\\x99 I donâ\\x80\\x99 want yeh ter go readinâ\\x80\\x99 more inter this than there is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook out,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione tersely.\\n\\nThey turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho!â\\x80\\x9d he wheezed. â\\x80\\x9cOut of bed so late, thisâ\\x80\\x99ll mean detention!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo it wonâ\\x80\\x99, Filch,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid shortly. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re with me, arenâ\\x80\\x99 they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what difference does that make?â\\x80\\x9d asked Filch obnoxiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a ruddy teacher, arenâ\\x80\\x99 I, yeh sneakinâ\\x80\\x99 Squib!â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, firing up at once.\\n\\nThere was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filchâ\\x80\\x99s skinny ankles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet goin,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.\\n\\nHarry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s and Filchâ\\x80\\x99s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,\\n\\nWhen thereâ\\x80\\x99s strife and when thereâ\\x80\\x99s trouble\\n\\nCall on Peevsie, heâ\\x80\\x99ll make double!\\n\\nThe Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.\\n\\nSo Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins â\\x80¦ or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?\\n\\nWas it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteenyearolds. â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere you are, Potter!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been waiting for you to come back,â\\x80\\x9d said McLaggen, disregarding Harryâ\\x80\\x99s drawn wand. â\\x80\\x9cMustâ\\x80\\x99ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t look like heâ\\x80\\x99ll be fit for next weekâ\\x80\\x99s match.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh . . . right. . . Quidditch,â\\x80\\x9d he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. â\\x80\\x9cYeah â\\x80¦ he might not make it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be playing Keeper, wonâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x9d said McLaggen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYeah, I suppose so. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed secondbest in the trials.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent,â\\x80\\x9d said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. â\\x80\\x9cSo whenâ\\x80\\x99s practice?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? Oh . . . thereâ\\x80\\x99s one tomorrow evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry unenthusiastically. â\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll hear them tomorrow, then. Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty tired now â\\x80¦ see you . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katieâ\\x80\\x99s attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions masterâ\\x80\\x99s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\\n\\nHarry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .\\n\\nBut Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.\\n\\nHe could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggenâ\\x80\\x99s Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cI mean, I am his girlfriend!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 but unfortunately slithad now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of indepth chats with him about Ronâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook, why donâ\\x80\\x99t you talk to Ron about all this?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new drew robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be â\\x80\\x9cserious.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I would, but heâ\\x80\\x99s always asleep when I go and see him!â\\x80\\x9d said Lavender fretfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s row and keen m abuse McLaggen as much as possible.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Hermione Granger still visiting him?â\\x80\\x9d Lavender demanded suddenly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I think so. Well, theyâ\\x80\\x99re friends, arenâ\\x80\\x99t they?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry uncomfortably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFriends, donâ\\x80\\x99t make me laugh,â\\x80\\x9d said Lavender scornfully. â\\x80\\x9cShe didnâ\\x80\\x99t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now heâ\\x80\\x99s all interesting. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you call getting poisoned being interesting?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry. â\\x80\\x9cAnyway â\\x80\\x94 sorry, got to go â\\x80\\x94 thereâ\\x80\\x99s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.\\n\\nOn the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo howâ\\x80\\x99s McLaggen shaping up?â\\x80\\x9d he asked Harry nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve told you,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry patiently, â\\x80\\x9che could be worldclass and I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,â\\x80\\x9d Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, â\\x80\\x9cwill you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? Sheâ\\x80\\x99s driving me mad as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking sheepish. â\\x80\\x9cYeah. All right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah . . . well. . . itâ\\x80\\x99s not that easy, is it?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. He paused. â\\x80\\x9cHermione going to look in before the match?â\\x80\\x9d he added casually.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sheâ\\x80\\x99s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking rather glum. â\\x80\\x9cRight. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag â\\x80\\x94 I mean, Smith.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll try,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, shouldering his broom. â\\x80\\x9cSee you after the match.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful.\\n\\nMalfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99re you going?â\\x80\\x9d Harry demanded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99m really going to tell you, because itâ\\x80\\x99s your business, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d sneered Malfoy. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better hurry up, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be waiting for â\\x80\\x98the Chosen Captainâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x98the Boy Who Scoredâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94 whatever they call you these days.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOne of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.\\n\\nHarry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harryâ\\x80\\x99s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere have you been?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI met Malfoy,â\\x80\\x9d Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo I wanted to know how come heâ\\x80\\x99s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes it matter right now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not likely to find out, am I?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. â\\x80\\x9cCome on then!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos.\\n\\nThere was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTricky conditions!â\\x80\\x9d McLaggen said bracingly to the team. â\\x80\\x9cCoote, Peakes, youâ\\x80\\x99ll want to fly out of the sun, so they donâ\\x80\\x99t see you coming â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily. â\\x80\\x9cJust get up by the goal posts!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOnce McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMake sure you do fly out of the sun,â\\x80\\x9d he told them grudgingly.\\n\\nHe shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hoochâ\\x80\\x99s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd thatâ\\x80\\x99s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,â\\x80\\x9d said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. â\\x80\\x9cHe did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now heâ\\x80\\x99s playing them â\\x80\\x94 oh, look, heâ\\x80\\x99s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her, sheâ\\x80\\x99s very nice. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared down at the commentatorâ\\x80\\x99s podium. Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirtyblonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . but now that big Hufflepuff playerâ\\x80\\x99s got the Quaffle from , her, I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember his name, itâ\\x80\\x99s something like Bibble â\\x80\\x94 no, Buggins â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s Cadwallader!â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna. The crowd laughed.\\n\\nHarry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMcLaggen, will you pay attention to what youâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not setting a great example!â\\x80\\x9d McLaggen shouted back, redfaced and furious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Harry Potterâ\\x80\\x99s now having an argument with his Keeper,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think thatâ\\x80\\x99ll help him find the Snitch, but maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s a clever ruse. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSwearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.\\n\\nGinny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the redandgoldclad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowdâ\\x80\\x99s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called â\\x80\\x9cLoserâ\\x80\\x99s Lurgy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeventyforty to Hufflepuff!â\\x80\\x9d barked Professor McGonagall into Lunaâ\\x80\\x99s megaphone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it, already?â\\x80\\x9d said Luna vaguely. â\\x80\\x9cOh, look! The Gryffindor Keeperâ\\x80\\x99s got hold of one of the Beaterâ\\x80\\x99s bats.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakesâ\\x80\\x99s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!â\\x80\\x9d roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.\\n\\nA blinding, sickening pain â\\x80¦ a flash of light. . . distant screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel. . .\\n\\nAnd the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiarlooking, freckly, redhaired person.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNice of you to drop in,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, grinning.\\n\\nHarry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago â\\x80¦ as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happened?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCracked skull,â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. â\\x80\\x9cNothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m keeping you in overnight. You shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t over exert yourself for a few hours.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to stay here overnight,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. â\\x80\\x9cI want to find McLaggen and kill him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid that would come under the heading of â\\x80\\x98overexertion,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. â\\x80\\x9cYou will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x99you know how much we lost by?â\\x80\\x9d he asked Ron through clenched teeth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yeah I do,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron apologetically. â\\x80\\x9cFinal score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrilliant,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry savagely. â\\x80\\x9cReally brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t want to get hold of him, heâ\\x80\\x99s the size of a troll,â\\x80\\x9d said\\n\\nRon reasonably. â\\x80\\x9cPersonally, I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Princeâ\\x80\\x99s. Anyway, the rest of the team mightâ\\x80\\x99ve dealt with him before you get out of here, theyâ\\x80\\x99re not happy. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI could hear the match commentary from here,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. â\\x80\\x9cI hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . . Loserâ\\x80\\x99s Lurgy â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ronâ\\x80\\x99s snorts subsided.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGinny came in to visit while you were unconscious,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a long pause, and Harryâ\\x80\\x99s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. . . .â\\x80\\x9dShe reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh . . .â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, as the scene in his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye imploded. â\\x80\\x9cYeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didnâ\\x80\\x99t look like they wanted to be with him, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s the second time heâ\\x80\\x99s made sure he isnâ\\x80\\x99t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?â\\x80\\x9d Harry sighed. â\\x80\\x9cWish Iâ\\x80\\x99d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be stupid,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron sharply. â\\x80\\x9cYou couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, youâ\\x80\\x99re the Captain!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to know what heâ\\x80\\x99s up to,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cAnd donâ\\x80\\x99t tell nn its all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never said it was all in your head,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! Youâ\\x80\\x99re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to catch him at it!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in frustration. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, whereâ\\x80\\x99s he going when he disappears off the map?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno . . . Hogsmeade?â\\x80\\x9d suggested Ron, yawning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell then, I dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nSilence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamp light above him, thinking. . . .\\n\\nIf only he had Rufus Scrimgeourâ\\x80\\x99s power, he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .\\n\\nThere was a low, rumbling snore from Ronâ\\x80\\x99s bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed.\\n\\nThis was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart. . . . That had been his most painful injury by far â\\x80¦ he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nHarry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed â\\x80\\x94 how could he have forgotten, why hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he thought\\n\\nof it before?\\n\\nBut the question was, how to call him? What did you do? Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreacher?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s going â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfreyâ\\x80\\x99s office and muttered, â\\x80\\x9cMuffliato!â\\x80\\x9d so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at\\n\\nwhat was going on.\\n\\nTwo houseelves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was watching that, Potty!â\\x80\\x9d he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. â\\x80\\x9cLook at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he wonâ\\x80\\x99t, or Dobby will shut Kreacherâ\\x80\\x99s mouth for him!â\\x80\\x9d cried Dobby in a highpitched voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 kicky, scratchy!â\\x80\\x9d cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits ofâ\\x80\\x99 chalk at the elves to enrage them further. â\\x80\\x9cTweaky, pokey!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacherâ\\x80\\x99s mistress say â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nExactly what Kreacherâ\\x80\\x99s mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacherâ\\x80\\x99s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, â\\x80\\x9cStick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, â\\x80\\x9cLanglock!â\\x80\\x9d Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNice one,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. â\\x80\\x9cThat was another Prince hex, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, twisting Kreacherâ\\x80\\x99s wizened arm into a half nelson. â\\x80\\x9cRight â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, youâ\\x80\\x99re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know Iâ\\x80\\x99m not allowed to give you orders â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDobby is a free houseelf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!â\\x80\\x9d said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOkay then,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaster called me?â\\x80\\x9d croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I did,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfreyâ\\x80\\x99s office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve got a job for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreacher will do whatever Master wants,â\\x80\\x9d said Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, â\\x80\\x9cbecause Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDobby will do it, Harry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Dobby, his tennisballsized eyes still swimming in tears. â\\x80\\x9cDobby would be honored to help Harry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cOkay then â\\x80¦ I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIgnoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ronâ\\x80\\x99s face, Harry went on, â\\x80\\x9cI want to know where heâ\\x80\\x99s going, who heâ\\x80\\x99s meeting, and what heâ\\x80\\x99s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Harry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement. â\\x80\\x9cAnd if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere wonâ\\x80\\x99t be any need for that,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry hastily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaster wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?â\\x80\\x9d croaked Kreacher. â\\x80\\x9cMaster wants me to spy upon the pureblood greatnephew of my old mistress?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the one,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. â\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what youâ\\x80\\x99re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or â\\x80¦ or to contact him in any way. Got it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harrys great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, â\\x80\\x9cMaster thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s settled, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll want regular reports, but make sure Iâ\\x80\\x99m not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And donâ\\x80\\x99t tell anyone what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20: Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s Request\\n\\n\\nHarry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did they row about?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventhfloor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all right!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. â\\x80\\x9cHere â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, â\\x80\\x9cReparo.â\\x80\\x9d The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI swear theyâ\\x80\\x99re getting smaller,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind her,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, a little impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cWhat did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludgu at you,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt mustâ\\x80\\x99ve looked funny,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron reasonably. â\\x80\\x9cIt didnâ\\x80\\x99t look funny at all!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione hotly. â\\x80\\x9cIt looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadnâ\\x80\\x99t caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, still trying to sound casual. â\\x80\\x9cOr are they still together?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, they are â\\x80\\x94 but why are you so interested?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI just donâ\\x80\\x99t want my Quidditch team messed up again!â\\x80\\x9d he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, â\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. â\\x80\\x9cOh, hi, Luna.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n- â\\x80\\x9cI went to the hospital wing to find you,â\\x80\\x9d said Luna, rummaging in her bag. â\\x80\\x9cBut they said youâ\\x80\\x99d leftâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ronâ\\x80\\x99s hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been told to give you this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTonight,â\\x80\\x9d he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNice commentary last match!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re making fun of me, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cEveryone says I was dreadful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m serious!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?â\\x80\\x9d he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s a Gurdyroot,â\\x80\\x9d she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. â\\x80\\x9cYou can keep it if you like, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a few of them. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.â\\x80\\x9d And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know, sheâ\\x80\\x99s grown on me, Luna,â\\x80\\x9d he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. â\\x80\\x9cI know sheâ\\x80\\x99s insane, but itâ\\x80\\x99s in a good â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. â\\x80\\x9cHi,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron nervously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCâ\\x80\\x99mon,â\\x80\\x9d Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, â\\x80\\x9cWhy didnâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harryâ\\x80\\x99s Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks a lot, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock. â\\x80\\x9cListen, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to hurry or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be late for Dumbledore. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnter,â\\x80\\x9d called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sybill,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, â\\x80\\x9cthere is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really donâ\\x80\\x99t think there is any more to be said â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. â\\x80\\x9cIf you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. â\\x80¦\\n\\nPerhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease close the door and sit down, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired.\\n\\nHarry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Trelawney still isnâ\\x80\\x99t happy Firenze is teaching, then?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cDivination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know â\\x80\\x94 and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her â\\x80\\x94 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, â\\x80\\x9cBut never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly â\\x80\\x94 have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t give it to me.â\\x80\\x9d There was a little silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being Xrayed. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. â\\x80\\x9cWell . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd did that work?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWell, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d he said, a little desperately, â\\x80\\x9cit isnâ\\x80\\x99t that I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t bothered or anything, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just had other â\\x80\\x94 other things . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOther things on your mind,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. â\\x80\\x9cI see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSilence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore, Iâ\\x80\\x99m really sorry. I should have done more. â\\x80¦ I should have realized you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have asked me to do it if it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t really important.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you for saying that, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x9cMay I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do it, sir, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get it from him,â\\x80\\x9d he said earnestly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we shall say no more about it just now,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore more kindly, â\\x80\\x9cbut continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cVoldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked â\\x80¦ he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes,â\\x80\\x9d he mumbled shamefacedly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery good,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cNow, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sirâ\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut now, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cnow things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. â\\x80\\x9cI shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope you are not tired of diving into other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s memories, for they are curious recollections, these two,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThis first one came from a very old houseelf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Borgin and Burkes?â\\x80\\x9d Harry repeated, stunned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt Borgin and Burkes,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Dumbledore calmly. â\\x80\\x9cI think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokeyâ\\x80\\x99s memory. But this was not Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time â\\x80\\x94 I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided â\\x80\\x94 but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe wanted to stay here? Why?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, more amazed still.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cFirstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSecondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he didnâ\\x80\\x99t get the job, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you feel about that, sir?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry hesitantly. â\\x80\\x9cDeeply uneasy,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI had advised Armando against the appointment â\\x80\\x94 I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSomehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDefense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll bet he was,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, unable to contain himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, quite,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now it is time to hear from Hokey the houseelf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, â\\x80\\x9cAfter you, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest houseelf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHurry up, Hokey!â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah imperiously. â\\x80\\x9cHe said heâ\\x80\\x99d come at four, itâ\\x80\\x99s only a couple of minutes to and heâ\\x80\\x99s never been late yet!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe tucked away her powder puff as the houseelf straightened up. The top of the elfâ\\x80\\x99s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibahâ\\x80\\x99s chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do I look?â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLovely, madam,â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Hokey.\\n\\nHarry could only assume that it was down in Hokeyâ\\x80\\x99s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.\\n\\nA tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuick, quick, heâ\\x80\\x99s here, Hokey!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of goldembossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.\\n\\nThe houseelf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibahâ\\x80\\x99s fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI brought you flowers,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou naughty boy, you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have!â\\x80\\x9d squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. â\\x80\\x9cYou do spoil this old lady, Tom. â\\x80¦ Sit down, sit down. . . . Whereâ\\x80\\x99s Hokey? Ah â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe houseelf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistressâ\\x80\\x99s elbow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHelp yourself, Tom,â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah, â\\x80\\x9cI know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said it a hundred times. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, whatâ\\x80\\x99s your excuse for visiting this time?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, batring her lashes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblinmade armor,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort. â\\x80\\x9cFive hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, now, not so fast, or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll think youâ\\x80\\x99re only here for my trinkets!â\\x80\\x9d pouted Hepzibah.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am ordered here because of them,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort quietly. â\\x80\\x9cI am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Burke, phooey!â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve something to show you that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you wonâ\\x80\\x99t tell Mr. Burke Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got it? Heâ\\x80\\x99d never let me rest if he knew Iâ\\x80\\x99d shown it to you, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, youâ\\x80\\x99ll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. â\\x80¦ In fact, bring both, while youâ\\x80\\x99re at it. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere, madam,â\\x80\\x9d squeaked the houseelf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow,â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, â\\x80\\x9cI think youâ\\x80\\x99ll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to get their hands on this!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a longfingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibahâ\\x80\\x99s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s handsome features.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA badger,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. â\\x80\\x9cThen this was . . . ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHelga Hufflepuffâ\\x80\\x99s, as you very well know, you clever boy!â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. â\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? And all sorts of powers itâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to possess too, but I havenâ\\x80\\x99t tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s face as the cup was taken away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow then,â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah happily, â\\x80\\x9cwhereâ\\x80\\x99s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are â\\x80\\x94 take that away now, Hokey.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think youâ\\x80\\x99ll like this even more, Tom,â\\x80\\x9d she whispered. â\\x80\\x9cLean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay heâ\\x80\\x99d love to get it back when Iâ\\x80\\x99m gone. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.\\n\\nVoldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSlytherinâ\\x80\\x99s mark,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right!â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. â\\x80\\x9cI had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a raggedlooking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locketâ\\x80\\x99s chain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you all right, dear?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort quietly. â\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m very well. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought â\\x80\\x94 but a trick of the light, I suppose â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. â\\x80\\x9cHere, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again. â\\x80¦ The usual enchantmentsâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTime to leave, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. â\\x80\\x9cHokey the houseelf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistressâ\\x80\\x99s evening cocoa by accident.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo way!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see we are of one mind,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cCertainly, then are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHokey confessed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe remembered putting something in her mistressâ\\x80\\x99s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and littleknown poison, said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cIt was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVoldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, that is my conclusion too,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 because she was a houseelf,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. â\\x80\\x9cPrecisely,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cShe was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over â\\x80\\x94 but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibahâ\\x80\\x99s family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cif you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfinâ\\x80\\x99s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, frowning, â\\x80\\x9cit seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe locket maybe,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbut why take the cup as well?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt had belonged to another of Hogwartsâ\\x80\\x99s founders,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. â\\x80¦ I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s memory for us. Ten years separates Hokeyâ\\x80\\x99s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .â\\x80\\x9d Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhose memory is it?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. â\\x80\\x9cMine,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nAnd Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the presentday office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.\\n\\nThe younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, â\\x80\\x9cEnter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.\\n\\nThe Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood evening, Tom,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore easily. â\\x80\\x9cWonâ\\x80\\x99t you sit down?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured â\\x80\\x94 the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. â\\x80\\x9cI heard that you had become headmaster,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. â\\x80\\x9cA worthy choice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am glad you approve,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cMay I offer you a drink?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat would be welcome,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort. â\\x80\\x9cI have come a long way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk. . â\\x80\\x9cSo, Tom â\\x80¦ to what do I owe the pleasure?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey do not call me â\\x80\\x98Tomâ\\x80\\x99 anymore,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThese days, 1 am known as â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know what you are known as,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly. â\\x80\\x9cBut to me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their chargesâ\\x80\\x99 youthful beginnings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s refusal to use Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am surprised you have remained here so long,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort after a short pause. â\\x80\\x9cI always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, still smiling, â\\x80\\x9cto a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see it still,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort. â\\x80\\x9cI merely wondered why you â\\x80\\x94 who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThree times at the last count, actually,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBut the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have returned,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a little while, â\\x80\\x9clater, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cRumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemortâ\\x80\\x99s expression remained impassive as he said, â\\x80\\x9cGreatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou call it â\\x80\\x98greatness,â\\x80\\x99 what you have been doing, do you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore delicately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. â\\x80\\x9cI have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf some kinds of magic,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore corrected him quietly. â\\x80\\x9cOf some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe old argument,â\\x80\\x9d he said softly. â\\x80\\x9cBut nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort. â\\x80\\x9cWill you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. â\\x80\\x9cAnd what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves â\\x80\\x94 or so rumor has it â\\x80\\x94 the Death Eaters?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friends,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause, â\\x80\\x9cwill carry on without me, I am sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am glad to hear that you consider them friends,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken,â\\x80\\x9d said Voldemort.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen if I were to go to the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Head tonight, I would not find a group of them â\\x80\\x94 Nott, Rosier, Muldber, Dolohov â\\x80\\x94 awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere could be no doubt that Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore lightly. â\\x80\\x9cNow, Tom . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort looked coldly surprised. â\\x80\\x9cA job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it youâ\\x80\\x99re after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort sneered. â\\x80\\x9cIf you do not want to give me a job â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I donâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I donâ\\x80\\x99t think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nVoldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage. â\\x80\\x9cThis is your final word?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, also standing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen we have nothing more to say to each other.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, nothing,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. â\\x80\\x9cThe time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. â\\x80¦ I wish I could. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.\\n\\nHarry felt Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s hand was blackened and deadlooking once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s face. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did he come back? Did you ever find out?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have ideas,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cbut no more than that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat ideas, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear â\\x80¦ to both of us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didnâ\\x80\\x99t say. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cThe aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21: The Unknowable Room\\n\\n\\nHarry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wonâ\\x80\\x99t find anything in there,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t start, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cIf it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for the Prince, Ron wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be sitting here now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe would if youâ\\x80\\x99d just listened to Snape in our first year,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione dismissively.\\n\\nHarry ignored her. He had just found an incantation â\\x80\\x9cSectumsempra!â\\x80\\x9d scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words â\\x80\\x9cFor enemies,â\\x80\\x9d and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twentyfirst of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.\\n\\nRon had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt least you can Apparate, though!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron tensely. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll have no trouble come July!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve only done it once,â\\x80\\x9d Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.\\n\\nHaving wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m telling you, the stupid Prince isnâ\\x80\\x99t going to be able to help you with this, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, more loudly. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s only one way to force someone to do what you want, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I know that, thanks,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, not looking up from the book. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s why Iâ\\x80\\x99m looking for something different. Dumbledorf says Veritaserum wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re going about it the wrong way,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cOnly you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people canâ\\x80\\x99t. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you spell â\\x80\\x98belligerentâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. â\\x80\\x9cIt canâ\\x80\\x99t be B â\\x80\\x94 U â\\x80\\x94 M â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, pulling Ronâ\\x80\\x99s essay toward her. â\\x80\\x9cAnd â\\x80\\x98auguryâ\\x80\\x99 doesnâ\\x80\\x99t begin O â\\x80\\x94 R â\\x80\\x94 G either. What kind of quill are you using?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s one of Fred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s SpellCheck ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it must,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, â\\x80\\x9cbecause we were asked how weâ\\x80\\x99d deal with dementors, not â\\x80\\x98Dugbogsâ\\x80\\x99, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember you changing your name to â\\x80\\x98Roonil Wazlibâ\\x80\\x99 either.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh no!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, staring horrorstruck at the parchment. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t say Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to write the whole thing out again!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s okay, we can fix it,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love you, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t let Lavender hear you saying that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c1 wonâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron into his hands. â\\x80\\x9cOr maybe I will, then sheâ\\x80\\x99ll ditch me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you ditch her if you want to finish it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t ever chucked anyone, have you?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cYou and Cho just â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSort of fell apart, yeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWish that would happen with me and Lavender,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. â\\x80\\x9cBut the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. Itâ\\x80\\x99s like going out with the giant squid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ronâ\\x80\\x99s essay.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks a million,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cCan I borrow your quill for the conclusion?â\\x80\\x9d Harry, who had found nothing useful in the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s quill. Harry had just closed the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s book, yawning, when â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nCrack!\\n\\nHermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, â\\x80\\x9cKreacher!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe houseelf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. â\\x80\\x9cMaster said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to giveâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nCrack!\\n\\nDobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his teacozy hat askew. â\\x80\\x9cDobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d he squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is this?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s going on, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; houseelves were always such a touchy subject with her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell. . . theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been following Malfoy for me,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNight and day,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Kreacher.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. Hermione looked indignant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell him not to â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, of course I didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cDobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?â\\x80\\x9d he hastened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaster Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Kreacher at once. â\\x80\\x9cHis features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those ofâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDraco Malfoy is a bad boy!â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Dobby angrily. â\\x80\\x9cA bad boy who â\\x80\\x94 who â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Harry Potter,â\\x80\\x9d he panted. â\\x80\\x9cDobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters.â\\x80\\x9d Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, â\\x80\\x9cBut Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a houseelf!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, we donâ\\x80\\x99t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,â\\x80\\x9d Harry told Kreacher. â\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s fast forward to where heâ\\x80\\x99s actually been going.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nKreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, â\\x80\\x9cMaster Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in a variety ofâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDobby, you tell me,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. â\\x80\\x9cHas he been going anywhere he shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry Potter, sir,â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, â\\x80\\x9cthe Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Room of Requirement!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced PotionMaking. Hermione and Ron stared at him. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s where heâ\\x80\\x99s been sneaking off to! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s where heâ\\x80\\x99s doingâ\\x80¦ whatever heâ\\x80\\x99s doing! And I bet thatâ\\x80\\x99s why heâ\\x80\\x99s been disappearing off the map â\\x80\\x94 come to think of it, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99ll be part of the magic of the room,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cIf you need it to be unplottable, it will be.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s doing?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry eagerly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Harry Potter, that is impossible,â\\x80\\x9d said Dobby.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, itâ\\x80\\x99s not,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once. â\\x80\\x9cMalfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you will, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione slowly. â\\x80\\x9cMalfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didnâ\\x80\\x99t he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to ask it to transform into.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99ll be a way around that,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry dismissively. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve done brilliantly, Dobby.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKreachers done well too,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, â\\x80\\x9cThe Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGet out of it,â\\x80\\x9d Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Harry Potter, sir!â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow good is this?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elffree again. â\\x80\\x9cWe know where Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s going! Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got him cornered now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, itâ\\x80\\x99s great,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost completed essay. Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut whatâ\\x80\\x99s all this about him going up there with a variety of studentsâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cHow many people are in on it? You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99d trust lots of them to know what heâ\\x80\\x99s doingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, that is weird,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cI heard him telling Crabbe it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t Crabbeâ\\x80\\x99s business what he was doingâ\\x80¦ so whatâ\\x80\\x99s he telling all theseâ\\x80¦ all theseâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d Harryâ\\x80\\x99s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. â\\x80\\x9cGod, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been stupid,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cIts obvious, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He couldâ\\x80\\x99ve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNicked what?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPolyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lessonâ\\x80¦ There arenâ\\x80\\x99t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoyâ\\x80¦ itâ\\x80\\x99s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. â\\x80¦Yeah, it all fits!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re stupid enough to do what theyâ\\x80\\x99re told even if he wonâ\\x80\\x99t tell them what heâ\\x80\\x99s up to, but he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so heâ\\x80\\x99s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other peopleâ\\x80¦ Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch â\\x80\\x94 ha! Crabbe and Goyle!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to say,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a hushed voice, â\\x80\\x9cthat that little girl whose scales I repaired â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, of course!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry loudly, staring at her. â\\x80\\x9cOf course! Malfoy mustâ\\x80\\x99ve been inside the room at the time, so she â\\x80\\x94 what am I talking about? â\\x80\\x94 he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to corne out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?â\\x80\\x9d guffawed Ron. â\\x80\\x9cBlimeyâ\\x80¦ no wonder they donâ\\x80\\x99t look too happy these days. Iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised they donâ\\x80\\x99t tell him to stuff it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, would they, if heâ\\x80\\x99s shown them his Dark Mark?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHmmmâ\\x80¦ the Dark Mark we donâ\\x80\\x99t know exists,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ronâ\\x80\\x99s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll seeâ\\x80\\x9d said Harry confidently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, we will,â\\x80\\x9d Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. â\\x80\\x9cBut, Harry, before you get all excited, I still donâ\\x80\\x99t think youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing whatâ\\x80\\x99s there firstâ\\x80\\x99. And I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you should forgetâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cthat what youâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron. â\\x80\\x9cWhat dâ\\x80\\x99you think?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWish I could Disapparate like a houseelf,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d have that Apparition Test in the bag.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had-=- been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s, what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A ston room? A workshop? Harrys mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snapeâ\\x80¦\\n\\nHarry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t forgotten about Slughorn, but I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t I find out what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s doing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirementâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cyou should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyone we know â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s all right, heâ\\x80\\x99s not dead â\\x80\\x94 its Mundungus, heâ\\x80\\x99s been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nineyearold boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.\\n\\nHarry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an elevenyearold girl.\\n\\nHe closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirementâ\\x80\\x99s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, â\\x80\\x9cI need to see what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s doing in hereâ\\x80¦ I need to see what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s doing in hereâ\\x80¦ I need to see what Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s doing in hereâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThree times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it â\\x80\\x94 but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOkay,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry aloud. â\\x80\\x9cOkayâ\\x80¦ I thought the wrong thingâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, concentrating as hard as he could. â\\x80\\x9cI need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretlyâ\\x80¦ I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretlyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.\\n\\nThere was no door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come off it,â\\x80\\x9d he told the wall irritably. â\\x80\\x9cThat was a clear instruction. Fine.â\\x80\\x9d He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. â\\x80\\x9cI need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes.\\n\\nThere was still no door.\\n\\nHarry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.\\n\\nHarry tried every variation of â\\x80\\x9cI need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside youâ\\x80\\x9d that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLate again, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. â\\x80\\x9cTen points from Gryfrindor.â\\x80\\x9d Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and organizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBefore we start, I want your dementor essays,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twentyfive scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page â\\x80\\x94 what is it, Mr. Finnigan?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said Seamus, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape in a bored voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut sir, I heard people talking â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the socalled Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cShouldnâ\\x80\\x99t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. â\\x80\\x9cLet us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cEr â\\x80\\x94 well â\\x80\\x94 ghosts are transparent â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, very good,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Snape, his lip curling. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. â\\x80\\x98Ghosts are transparent.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x98\\n\\nPansy Parkinson let out a highpitched giggle. Several other people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, â\\x80\\x9cYeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, arenâ\\x80\\x99t they? So theyâ\\x80\\x99d be solid â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA fiveyearold could have told us as much,â\\x80\\x9d sneered Snape. â\\x80\\x9cThe Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizardâ\\x80\\x99s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizardâ\\x80\\x99s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what Harry said is the most useful if weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to tell them apart!â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cWhen we come facetoface with one down a dark alley, weâ\\x80\\x99re going to be having a look to see if its solid, arenâ\\x80\\x99t we, weâ\\x80\\x99re not going to be asking, â\\x80\\x98Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnother ten points from Gryffindor,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cI would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione, grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no point, youâ\\x80\\x99ll just end up in detention again, leave it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, smirking a little, â\\x80\\x9cand read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ronâ\\x80\\x99s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boysâ\\x80\\x99 bathroom with Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnapeâ\\x80\\x99s right, though, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. â\\x80\\x9cI dunno whether itâ\\x80\\x99s worth me taking the test. I just canâ\\x80\\x99t get the hang of Apparition.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry reasonably. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if youâ\\x80\\x99re still not â\\x80\\x94 you know â\\x80\\x94 as good as youâ\\x80\\x99d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer â\\x80\\x94 Myrtle, this is the boysâ\\x80\\x99 bathroom!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. â\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d she said glumly. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s you two.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho were you expecting?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNobody,â\\x80\\x9d said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. â\\x80\\x9cHe said heâ\\x80\\x99d come back and see me, but then you said youâ\\x80\\x99d pop in and visit me tooâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 she gave Harry a reproachful look â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cand I havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen you for months and months. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learned not to expect too much from boys.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you lived in that girlsâ\\x80\\x99 bathroom?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with a sulky little shrug, â\\x80\\x9cbut that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVividly,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I thought he liked me,â\\x80\\x9d she said plaintively. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe if you two left, heâ\\x80\\x99d come back again. We had lots in common. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure he felt it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she looked hopefully toward the door. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you say you had lots in common,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, sounding rather amused now, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x99you mean he lives in an Sbend too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. â\\x80\\x9cI mean heâ\\x80\\x99s sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got anybody to talk to, and heâ\\x80\\x99s not afraid to show his feelings and cry!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s been a boy in here crying?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry curiously. â\\x80\\x9cA young boy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever you mind!â\\x80\\x9d said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. â\\x80\\x9cI promised I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell anyone, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take his secret to the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 not the grave, surely?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron with a snort. â\\x80\\x9cThe sewers, maybe.â\\x80\\x9d Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re right,â\\x80\\x9d he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d do better,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, â\\x80\\x9cto go straight to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office and try and get that memory from him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying to get him on his own again, and heâ\\x80\\x99s not going to let it happen!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, youâ\\x80\\x99ve just got to keep at it, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.\\n\\nOnce out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, â\\x80\\x9cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good,â\\x80\\x9d and scanned it carefully.\\n\\nAs it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventhfloor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering, â\\x80\\x9cHelloâ\\x80¦youâ\\x80\\x99re very pretty, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGoyle gave a highpitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.\\n\\nYet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOUCH!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe spun around, onelegged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99re you doing here?â\\x80\\x9d he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI came to see Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks. Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mousecolored hair lank.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis office isnâ\\x80\\x99t here,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s not there. Apparently heâ\\x80\\x99s gone away again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas he?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. â\\x80\\x9cHey â\\x80\\x94 you donâ\\x80\\x99t know where he goes, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you want to see him about?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing in particular,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. â\\x80\\x9cI just thought he might know whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard rumorsâ\\x80¦ people getting hurt.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I know, itâ\\x80\\x99s all been in the papers,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cThat little kid trying to kill his â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Prophetâ\\x80\\x99s often behind the times,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, who didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be listening to him. â\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo one from the Order writes to me anymore,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cnot since Sirius â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered awkwardly. â\\x80\\x9cI meanâ\\x80¦ I miss him, as well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. â\\x80\\x9cWell. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you around, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.\\n\\nHe found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did it â\\x80\\x94 well, kind of!â\\x80\\x9d Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. â\\x80\\x9cI was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshafts, but at least I moved!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood one,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x99d you do, Hermione?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, she was perfect, obviously,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, before Hermione could answer. â\\x80\\x9cPerfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is â\\x80\\x94 we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve heard Twycross going on about her â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be surprised if he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t pop the question soon â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what about you?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. â\\x80\\x9cHave you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYep,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cAnd guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTonks?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, she said sheâ\\x80\\x99d come to visit Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you ask me,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x99s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a bit odd,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s supposed to be guarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when heâ\\x80\\x99s not even here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had a thought,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s territory than his. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t think she can have beenâ\\x80¦ you knowâ\\x80¦ in love with Sirius?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHermione stared at him. â\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth makes you say that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, shrugging, â\\x80\\x9cbut she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus is a big fourlegged thing now. I wondered whether it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t becomeâ\\x80¦ you knowâ\\x80¦ him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a thought,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione slowly. â\\x80\\x9cBut I still donâ\\x80\\x99t know why sheâ\\x80\\x99d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if thatâ\\x80\\x99s really why she was here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoes back to what I said, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,â\\x80\\x9d he said wisely to Harry, â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99re easily upset.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, â\\x80\\x9cI doubt youâ\\x80\\x99d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didnâ\\x80\\x99t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon scowled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22: After the Burial\\n\\n\\nPatches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the last time, just forget about Malfoy,â\\x80\\x9d Hermione told Harry firmly.\\n\\nThey were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet â\\x80\\x94 Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them â\\x80\\x94 for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.\\n\\nRon gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t Lavender,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione wearily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, good,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, relaxing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry Potter?â\\x80\\x9d said the girl. â\\x80\\x9cI was asked to give you this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanksâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, â\\x80\\x9cDumbledore said we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe he wants to check on how youâ\\x80\\x99re doing?â\\x80\\x9d suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.\\n\\nDear Harry, Ron and Hermione! Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him and you know how special he was. Hermione, I know youâ\\x80\\x99d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if youâ\\x80\\x99d nip down for the burial later this evening. Iâ\\x80\\x99m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. I know youâ\\x80\\x99re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t ask, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t face it alone. Hagrid\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook at this,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, handing the note to Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cOh, for heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake,â\\x80\\x9d she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s mentalâ\\x80\\x9d he said furiously. â\\x80\\x9cThat thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIts not just that,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows securityâ\\x80\\x99s a million times tighter and how much trouble weâ\\x80\\x99d be in if we were caught.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve been down to see him by night before,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but for something like this?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all â\\x80\\x94 Aragogâ\\x80\\x99s dead. If it were a question of saving him â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99d want to go even less,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron firmly. â\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, you canâ\\x80\\x99t be thinking of going,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s such a pointless thing to get detention for.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry sighed. â\\x80\\x9cYeah, I know,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI sâ\\x80\\x99pose Hagridâ\\x80\\x99ll have to bury Aragog without us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he will,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, looking relieved. â\\x80\\x9cLook, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFiftyseventh time lucky, you think?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry bitterly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLucky,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, thatâ\\x80\\x99s it â\\x80\\x94 get lucky!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat dâ\\x80\\x99you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUse your lucky potion!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRon, thatâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99s it!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, sounding stunned. â\\x80\\x9cOf course! Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t I think of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared at them both. â\\x80\\x9cFelix Felicis?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat for?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Ron incredulously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione.\\n\\nHarry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry? Are you still with us?â\\x80\\x9d asked Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWha â\\x80\\x94 ? Yeah, of course,â\\x80\\x9d he said, pulling himself together. â\\x80\\x9cWell. . . okay. If I canâ\\x80\\x99t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s decided, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. â\\x80\\x9cDestination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .â\\x80\\x9d she murmured.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, stop that,â\\x80\\x9d Ron begged her, â\\x80\\x9cI feel sick enough as it is â\\x80\\x94 quick, hide me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t Lavender!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCool,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, peering over Hermiones shoulder to check. â\\x80\\x9cBlimey, they donâ\\x80\\x99t look happy, do they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re the Montgomery sisters and of course they donâ\\x80\\x99t look happy, didnâ\\x80\\x99t you hear what happened to their little brother?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m losing track of whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening to everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s relatives, to be honest,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungos, they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t save him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe died?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Harry, shocked. â\\x80\\x9cBut surely werewolves donâ\\x80\\x99t kill, they just turn you into one of them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey sometimes kill,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was the werewolfâ\\x80\\x99s name?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew it â\\x80\\x94 the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry angrily.\\n\\nHermione looked at him bleakly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to get that memory,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all about stopping Voldemort, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll do fine,â\\x80\\x9d Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test. â\\x80\\x9cGood luck.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you too!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.\\n\\nThere were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll too young to Apparate just yet?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorh genially, â\\x80\\x9cNot turned seventeen yet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey shook their heads.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh well,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn cheerily, â\\x80\\x9cas weâ\\x80\\x99re so few, weâ\\x80\\x99ll do something for fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat sounds good, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, â\\x80\\x99something amusingâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d he said irritably. â\\x80\\x9cOh, surprise me,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn airily.\\n\\nMalfoy opened his copy of Advanced PotionMaking with a sulky expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.\\n\\nWas it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner! Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort. . . . There could be only one conclusion, in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.\\n\\nCheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking and found a heavily corrected HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s version of â\\x80\\x9cAn Elixir to Induce Euphoria,â\\x80\\x9d which seemed not only to meet Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s instructions, but which might (Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s cauldron. â\\x80\\x9cEuphoria, I take it? And whatâ\\x80\\x99s that I smell? Mmmm . . . youâ\\x80\\x99ve added just a sprig of peppermint, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nosetweaking. â\\x80¦ I really donâ\\x80\\x99t know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry pushed the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s book deeper into his bag with his foot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s just your motherâ\\x80\\x99s genes coming out in you!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh . . . yeah, maybe,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, relieved.\\n\\nErnie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sourfaced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely â\\x80\\x9cpassable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. â\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor â\\x80\\x94 Professor, donâ\\x80\\x99t you want to taste my po â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d called Harry desperately.\\n\\nBut Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the cauldron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.\\n\\nRon and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry!â\\x80\\x9d cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, I passed!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell done!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Ron?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe â\\x80\\x94 he just failed,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. â\\x80\\x9cIt was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that heâ\\x80\\x99d left half an eyebrow behind. . . How did it go with Slughorn?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo joy,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, as Ron joined them. â\\x80\\x9cBad luck, mate, but youâ\\x80\\x99ll pass next time â\\x80\\x94 we can take it together.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I sâ\\x80\\x99pose,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron grumpily. â\\x80\\x9cBut half an eyebrow â\\x80\\x93 like that matters!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione soothingly, â\\x80\\x9cit does seem really harsh. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, Harry â\\x80\\x94 you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?â\\x80\\x9d Ron demanded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, I sâ\\x80\\x99pose Iâ\\x80\\x99d better,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t reckon Iâ\\x80\\x99ll need all of it, not twentyfour hoursâ\\x80\\x99 worth, it canâ\\x80\\x99t take all nightâ\\x80¦. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a great feeling when you take it,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron reminiscently. â\\x80\\x9cLike you canâ\\x80\\x99t do anything wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you talking about?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve never taken any!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, but I thought I had, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, as though explaining the obvious. â\\x80\\x9cSame difference really â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boysâ\\x80\\x99 dormitory.\\n\\nHarry took out the rolledup socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, here goes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat does it feel like?â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione.\\n\\nHarry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at allâ\\x80¦ and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. . . .\\n\\nHe got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cReally excellent. Right. . . Iâ\\x80\\x99m going down to Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Harry â\\x80\\x94 youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry confidently. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a good feeling about going to Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?â\\x80\\x9d asked Ron, looking stunned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. â\\x80\\x9cI feel like itâ\\x80\\x99s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is Felix Felicis, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. â\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t got another little bottle full ofâ\\x80\\x94 I donâ\\x80\\x99t know â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEssence of Insanity?â\\x80\\x9d suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders.\\n\\nHarry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTrust me,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing â\\x80¦ or at leastâ\\x80\\x9d he strolled confidently to the doorâ\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cFelix does.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat were you doing up there with her!â\\x80\\x9d shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boysâ\\x80\\x99 dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.\\n\\nGetting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t push me, please, Dean,â\\x80\\x9d she said, sounding annoyed. ; â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort.. . . His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.\\n\\nWhy he knew that going to Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.\\n\\nIt was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,â\\x80\\x9d Slughorn was saying courteously, â\\x80\\x9cmost authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I quite agree,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Sprout warmly. â\\x80\\x9cThat enough for you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlenty, plenty,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. â\\x80\\x9cThis should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody overstews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nProfessor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible.\\n\\nSeized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood evening, Professor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMerlinâ\\x80\\x99s beard, Harry, you made me jump,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. â\\x80\\x9cHow did you get out of the castle?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think Filch mustâ\\x80\\x99ve forgotten to lock the doors,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be reporting that man, heâ\\x80\\x99s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out then, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, itâ\\x80\\x99s Hagrid,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s pretty upset. . . But you wonâ\\x80\\x99t tell anyone, Professor? I donâ\\x80\\x99t want trouble for him. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughornâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity was evidently aroused. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I canâ\\x80\\x99t promise that,â\\x80\\x9d he said gruffly. â\\x80\\x9cBut I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure he canâ\\x80\\x99t be up to anything very dreadful. ..â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, itâ\\x80\\x99s this giant spider, heâ\\x80\\x99s had it for years. â\\x80¦ It lived in the forest. â\\x80¦ It could talk and everything â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s true, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cBut this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. Heâ\\x80\\x99s devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said Iâ\\x80\\x99d go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTouching, touching,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s cabin. â\\x80\\x9cBut acromantula venom is very valuable â\\x80¦ If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some â\\x80¦ I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. â\\x80\\x9c. . . seems an awful waste not to collect itâ\\x80¦ might get a hundred Galleons a pint. â\\x80¦ To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, â\\x80\\x9cwell, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better sendoff, you know â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm. â\\x80\\x9cI tell you what, Harry, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . Weâ\\x80\\x99ll drink the poor beastâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94 well â\\x80\\x94 not health â\\x80\\x94 but weâ\\x80\\x99ll send it off in style, anyway, once itâ\\x80\\x99s buried. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occasion. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s, delighted with himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYen came,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah â\\x80\\x94 Ron and Hermione couldnâ\\x80\\x99t, though,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re really sorry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDon â\\x80\\x94 don matter . . . Hedâ\\x80\\x99ve bin touched yehâ\\x80\\x99re here, though, Harry. . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere are we burying him?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. â\\x80\\x9cThe forest?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlimey, no,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. â\\x80\\x9cThe other spiders wonâ\\x80\\x99 let me anywhere near their webs now Aragogâ\\x80\\x99s gone. Turns out it was only on his orders they didnâ\\x80\\x99 eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe honest answer was â\\x80\\x9cyesâ\\x80\\x9d; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come facetoface with the aeromantulas. They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever bin an area oâ\\x80\\x99 the forest I couldnâ\\x80\\x99 go before!â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, shaking his head. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99 easy, gettinâ\\x80\\x99 Aragogâ\\x80\\x99s body out oâ\\x80\\x99 there, I can tell yeh â\\x80\\x94 they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give â\\x80\\x98im a nice burialâ\\x80¦ a proper sendoff. . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in trouble, are yeh?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. â\\x80\\x9cYeh shouldnâ\\x80\\x99 be outta the castle in the eveninâ\\x80\\x99, I know it, itâ\\x80\\x99s my fault â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, when he heard what I was doing he said heâ\\x80\\x99d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s gone to change into something more suitable, I thinkâ\\x80¦and he said heâ\\x80\\x99d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragogâ\\x80\\x99s memoryâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid he?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. â\\x80\\x9cThaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x94 thaâ\\x80\\x99s righâ\\x80\\x99 nice of him, that is, anâ\\x80\\x99 not turninâ\\x80\\x99 yeh in either. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. .. . Cominâ\\x80\\x99 ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well. . . heâ\\x80\\x99dâ\\x80\\x99ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJusâ\\x80\\x99 beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid in a choked voice. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve already dug the â\\x80\\x94 yeh know â\\x80\\x94 grave. Jusâ\\x80\\x99 thought weâ\\x80\\x99d say a few nice things over him â\\x80\\x94 happy memories, yeh know â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid,â\\x80\\x9d he said, in a deep, grave voice. â\\x80\\x9cSo very sorry to hear of your loss.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThaâ\\x80\\x99s very nice of yeh,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cThanks a lot. Anâ\\x80\\x99 thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have dreamed of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cSad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor creature?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut here,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid in a shaking voice. â\\x80\\x9cShall we â\\x80\\x94 shall we do it, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a tenfoot- high mound of freshly dug earth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMagnificent,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thougln he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIts not evâ\\x80\\x99ryone appreciates how beauâ\\x80\\x99iful they areâ\\x80\\x99 said H grid to Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99 know yeh were interested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInterested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. â\\x80\\x9cNow . . . shall we proceed to the burial?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, itâ\\x80\\x99s difficult for you, who knew him best,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s elbow, but patted it all the same. â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t I say a few words?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, â\\x80\\x9cFarewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you wonâ\\x80\\x99t forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, webspun places of your forest home. May your manyeyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTha was . . . tha was . . . beauâ\\x80\\x99iful!â\\x80\\x9d howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, there,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. â\\x80\\x9cLets get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . Thatâ\\x80\\x99s it. â\\x80¦ Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have had it all tested for poison,â\\x80\\x9d he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s bucketsized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. â\\x80\\x9cHad a houseelf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry saw, in his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye, the expression on Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves, and decided never to mention it to her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne for Harry . . .â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, â\\x80\\x9c. . . and one for me. Wellâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 he raised his mug high â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cto Aragog.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAragog,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry and Hagrid together. Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had him from an egg, yeh know,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid morosely. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. â\\x80\\x98Bout the size of a Pekingeseâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSweet,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUsed ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . wellâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagridâ\\x80\\x99s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s not unicorn hair, Hagrid?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid indifferently. â\\x80\\x9cGets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches anâ\\x80\\x99 stuff in the forest, yeh know â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut my dear chap, do you know how much thatâ\\x80\\x99s worth?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI use it fer bindinâ\\x80\\x99 on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, shrugging. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s dead useful. . . very strong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful su ply of oakmatured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.\\n\\nThe Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slugliorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.\\n\\nAfter an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elfmade wine, and to-\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry Potter!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d cried Slughorn a little thickly, â\\x80\\x9cParry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who â\\x80\\x94 well â\\x80\\x94 something of that sort,â\\x80\\x9d he mumbled, and drained his mug too.\\n\\nNot long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, â\\x80\\x9cTo friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAaargh, the good die young,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little crosseyed, while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain. â\\x80\\x9cMe dad was no age ter go â\\x80¦ nor were yer mumâ\\x80\\x99 anâ\\x80\\x99 dad, Harry . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGreat fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harryâ\\x80\\x99s arm and shook it\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBesâ\\x80\\x99 wiz and witchard oâ\\x80\\x99 their age â\\x80¦ I never knew.. . terrible thing . . . terrible thing â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Odo the hero, they bore him back home\\n\\nTo the place that heâ\\x80\\x99d known as a lad,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsang Slughorn plaintively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey laid him to rest with his hat inside out.\\n\\nAnd his wand snapped in two, which was sad.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . terrible,â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn with a hiccup. â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t carry a tune to save my life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid wasnâ\\x80\\x99t talking about your singing,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quietly. â\\x80\\x9cHe was talking about my mum and dad dying.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. â\\x80\\x9cOh dear. Yes, that was â\\x80\\x94 was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94 donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose you remember it, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d he asked awkwardly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo â\\x80\\x94 well, I was only one when they died,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s heavy snores. â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 I didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn in a hushed voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nSlughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe told her to get out of the way,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry remorselessly. â\\x80\\x9cHe told me she neednâ\\x80\\x99t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh dear,â\\x80\\x9d breathed Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cShe could have . . . she neednâ\\x80\\x99t . . . Thatâ\\x80\\x99s awful. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. â\\x80\\x9cBut she didnâ\\x80\\x99t move. Dad was already dead, but she didnâ\\x80\\x99t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort. . . but he just laughedâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s enough!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. â\\x80\\x9cReally, my dear boy, enough . . . Iâ\\x80\\x99m an old man â\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99t need to hear â\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hear â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI forgot,â\\x80\\x9d lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. â\\x80\\x9cYou liked her, didnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLiked her?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t imagine anyone who met her wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funnyâ\\x80¦ It was the most horrible thing. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you wonâ\\x80\\x99t help her son,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cShe gave me her life, but you wonâ\\x80\\x99t give me a memory.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagridâ\\x80\\x99s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s tearfilled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t say that,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered. â\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t a question â\\x80¦ If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt can,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry clearly. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledore needs information. I need information.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are the Chosen One?â\\x80\\x9d . . I.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I am,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry calmly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut then . . . my dear boy . . . youâ\\x80\\x99re asking a great deal. . . youâ\\x80\\x99re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, Harry, of course I do, but â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re scared heâ\\x80\\x99ll find out you helped me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe brave like my mother, Professor. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not proud . . .â\\x80\\x9d he whispered through his fingers. â\\x80\\x9cI am ashamed of what â\\x80\\x94 of what that memory shows. â\\x80¦ I think I may have done great damage that day. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be a very brave and noble thing to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait. Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you very much, Professor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re a good boy,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. â\\x80\\x9cAnd youâ\\x80\\x99ve got her eyes. . . . Just donâ\\x80\\x99t think too badly of me once youâ\\x80\\x99ve seen it. . . ,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23: Horcruxes\\n\\n\\nHarry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of time do you call this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m really sorry â\\x80\\x94 I had to go out for something important â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, the password changed at midnight, so youâ\\x80\\x99ll just have to sleep in the corridor, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re joking!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did it have to change at midnight?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the way it is,â\\x80\\x9d said the Fat Lady. â\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, heâ\\x80\\x99s the one whoâ\\x80\\x99s tightened security.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFantastic,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. â\\x80\\x9cReally brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because heâ\\x80\\x99s the one who wanted me to â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is here,â\\x80\\x9d said a voice behind Harry. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,â\\x80\\x9d said Nick. â\\x80\\x9cHe appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is he?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, his heart leaping,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, itâ\\x80\\x99s a, favorite pastime of his â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the Bloody Baron â\\x80\\x94 Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh â\\x80\\x94 in his office,â\\x80\\x9d said Nick. â\\x80\\x9cI believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, he has,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The passwordâ\\x80\\x99s still â\\x80\\x98tapewormâ\\x80\\x99!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying â\\x80\\x9ctoffee eclairsâ\\x80\\x9d to Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnter,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office, looking the same as ever, but with black, starstrewn skies beyond the windows.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood gracious, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore in surprise. â\\x80\\x9cTo what do I owe this very late pleasure?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir â\\x80\\x94 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got the memory from Slughorn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAll thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd now,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. â\\x80\\x9cNow, at last. we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, strawcolored hair and his gingeryblond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s goldandblack ring gleaming on his finger.\\n\\nDumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, â\\x80\\x9cSir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTom, Tom, if I knew I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. â\\x80\\x9cI must say, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter â\\x80\\x94 thank you for the pineapple, by the way, youâ\\x80\\x99re quite right, it is my favorite â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Several of the boys tittered again. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know that politics would suit me, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he said when the laughter had died away. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t have the right kind of background, for one thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leaderâ\\x80\\x99s famous ancestor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn briskly, â\\x80\\x9ccouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, youâ\\x80\\x99ll go far, Tom, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never been wrong about a student yet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe small golden clock standing upon Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s desk chimed eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock behind him and he looked around.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood gracious, is it that time already? Youâ\\x80\\x99d better get going boys, or weâ\\x80\\x99ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or itâ\\x80\\x99s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOne by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook shar\\n\\np, Tom, you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, I wanted to ask you something.â\\x80\\x9d -â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cAsk away, then, mâ\\x80\\x99boy, ask away. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSlughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProject for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot exactly, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle. â\\x80\\x9cI came across the term while reading and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t fully understand it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo . . . well. . . youâ\\x80\\x99d be hardpushed to find a book at Hogwarts thatâ\\x80\\x99ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, thatâ\\x80\\x99s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you â\\x80\\x94 sorry, I mean, if you canâ\\x80\\x99t tell me, obviously â\\x80\\x94 I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could â\\x80\\x94 so I just thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nIt was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, â\\x80\\x9cwell, it canâ\\x80\\x99t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite understand how that works, though, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle.\\n\\nHis voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you split your soul, you see,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, â\\x80\\x9cand hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if oneâ\\x80\\x99s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughornâ\\x80\\x99s face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: â\\x80\\x9cI was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Riddleâ\\x80\\x99s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you split your soul?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn uncomfortably, â\\x80\\x9cyou must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how do you do it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy an act of evil â\\x80\\x94 the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEncase? But how â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a spell, do not ask me, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know!â\\x80\\x9d said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. â\\x80\\x9d Do I look as though I have tried it â\\x80\\x94 do I look like a killer?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, of course not,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle quickly. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry â\\x80¦ I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to offend . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all, not at all, not offended,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn gruffly, â\\x80\\x9cIt is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand, though â\\x80\\x94 just out of curiosity â\\x80\\x94 I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isnâ\\x80\\x99t seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t seven â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMerlinâ\\x80\\x99s beard, Tom!â\\x80\\x9d yelped Slughorn. â\\x80\\x9cSeven! Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, â\\x80\\x9cthis is all hypothetical, what weâ\\x80\\x99re discussing, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? All academic . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle quickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve told â\\x80\\x94 thatâ\\x80\\x99s to say, what weâ\\x80\\x99ve discussed. People wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like to think weâ\\x80\\x99ve been chatting about Horcruxes. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s particularly fierce about it. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t say a word, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x9cLet us go. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore at last. â\\x80\\x9cIt confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cI am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think he succeeded then, sir?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHe made a Horcrux? And thatâ\\x80\\x99s why he didnâ\\x80\\x99t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA bitâ\\x80¦ or more,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cYou heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know â\\x80\\x94 as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew â\\x80\\x94 no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, â\\x80\\x9cFour years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHow?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou handed it to me, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cThe diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. â\\x80¦ a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c1 still donâ\\x80\\x99t understand,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work â\\x80\\x94 in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s monster would be unleashed again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t want his hard work to be wasted,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHe wanted people to know he was Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s heir, because he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t take credit at the time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite correct,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, nodding. â\\x80\\x9cBut donâ\\x80\\x99t you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody elseâ\\x80\\x99s path and run the risk that they might destroy it â\\x80\\x94 as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.\\n\\nThe careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made â\\x80\\x94 or had been planning to make â\\x80\\x94 more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. â\\x80\\x98I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.â\\x80\\x99 That was what you told me he said. â\\x80\\x98Further than anybody!â\\x80\\x99 And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call â\\x80\\x98usual evilâ\\x80\\x99 . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo heâ\\x80\\x99s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWhy couldnâ\\x80\\x99t he make a Sorcererâ\\x80\\x99s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,â\\x80\\x9d s;nÂ«l Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBut there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcererâ\\x80\\x99s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhile the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see â\\x80¦ or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: â\\x80\\x98Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isnâ\\x80\\x99t seven the most powerfully magical number . . .â\\x80\\x99 Isnâ\\x80\\x99t seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe made seven Horcruxes?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, horrorstruck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. â\\x80\\x9cBut they could be anywhere in the world â\\x80\\x94 hidden â\\x80\\x94 buried or invisible â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly. â\\x80\\x9cBut firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack â\\x80\\x94 the piece that lives in his body.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the six Horcruxes, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, a little desperately, â\\x80\\x9chow are we supposed to find them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry eagerly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burnedlooking hand. â\\x80\\x9cThe ring, Harry. Marvoloâ\\x80\\x99s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been â\\x80\\x94 forgive me the lack of seemly modesty â\\x80\\x94 for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut how did you find it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gauntâ\\x80\\x99s house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowever, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a sevenpart soul, four Horcruxes remain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd they could be anything?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cThey could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe diary wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that special.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, the other Horcruxes?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think you know what they are, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can only guess,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cFor the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe locket!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry loudly, â\\x80\\x9cHufflepuffâ\\x80\\x99s cup!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling, â\\x80\\x9cI would be prepared to bet â\\x80\\x94 perhaps not my other hand â\\x80\\x94 but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclawâ\\x80\\x99s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a rubyencrusted sword reposed within a glass case.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think thatâ\\x80\\x99s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cTo try and find something from one of the other founders?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy thoughts precisely,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBut unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four foundersâ\\x80\\x99 objects. He definitely had two â\\x80\\x94 he may have found three â\\x80\\x94 that is the best we can do for now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEven if he got something of Ravenclawâ\\x80\\x99s or of Gryffindorâ\\x80\\x99s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, counting on his fingers. â\\x80\\x9cUnless heâ\\x80\\x99s got both?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe snake?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, startled. â\\x80\\x9cYou can use animals as Horcruxes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is inadvisable to do so,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cbecause to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parentsâ\\x80\\x99 house with the intention of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cthe diaryâ\\x80\\x99s gone, the ringâ\\x80\\x99s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclawâ\\x80\\x99s or Gryffindorâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, bowing his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where youâ\\x80\\x99ve been going when youâ\\x80\\x99ve been leaving the school?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCorrect,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps â\\x80¦ I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd if you do,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly, â\\x80\\x9ccan I come with you and help get rid of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, â\\x80\\x9cYes, I think so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI can?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. â\\x80\\x9cI think you have earned that right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked, ignoring the portraits.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts sayso, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Luciusâ\\x80\\x99s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence â\\x80\\x94 but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, â\\x80\\x9cSo if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cWithout his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got uncommon skill and power,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, before he could stop himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, you have,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore firmly. â\\x80\\x9cYou have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cI can love!â\\x80\\x9d It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, â\\x80\\x9cBig deal!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Harry, you can love,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. â\\x80\\x9cWhich, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, when the prophecy says that Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have â\\x80\\x98power the Dark Lord knows not,â\\x80\\x99 it just means â\\x80\\x94 love?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes â\\x80\\x94 just love,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBut Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him â\\x80\\x94 and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it comes to the same â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, â\\x80\\x9cYou are setting too much store by the prophecy!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d spluttered Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbut you said the prophecy means â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, bewildered, â\\x80\\x9cbut last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawneyâ\\x80\\x99s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is essential that you understand this!â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. â\\x80\\x9cBy attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s followers!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I havenâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry indignantly. â\\x80\\x9cHe killed my mum and dad!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are protected, in short, by your ability to love!â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore loudly. â\\x80\\x9cThe only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heartâ\\x80\\x99s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, â\\x80\\x9cit all comes to the same thing, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to try and kill him, or â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGot to?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cOf course youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until youâ\\x80\\x99ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,\\n\\nthat you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d want him finished,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quietly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x99d want to do it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course you would!â\\x80\\x9d cried Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cYou see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. â\\x80¦ In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat one of us is going to end up killing the other,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew â\\x80\\x94 and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents â\\x80\\x94 that there was all the difference in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24: Sectumsempra\\n\\n\\nExhausted but delighted with his nightâ\\x80\\x99s work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morningâ\\x80\\x99s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s Horcruxes and Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s promise to take Harry along, should he find another one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWow,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. â\\x80\\x9cWow. Youâ\\x80\\x99re actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRon, youâ\\x80\\x99re making it snow,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Rons arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. â\\x80\\x9cSorryâ\\x80¦ looks like weâ\\x80\\x99ve all got horrible dandruff now. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe split up,â\\x80\\x9d he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth, â\\x80\\x9cLast night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWell â\\x80\\x94 you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind itâ\\x80\\x99s over, do you?â\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d Ron admitted. â\\x80\\x9cIt was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to finish it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCoward,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, though she looked amused. â\\x80\\x9cWell, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, â\\x80\\x9cHow come?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t climb in herself . . . but theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been a bit rocky for ages.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat dâ\\x80\\x99you mean?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Quidditch team,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cIf Ginnyand Dean arenâ\\x80\\x99t speaking . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh â\\x80\\x94 oh yeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFlitwick,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s and Ronâ\\x80\\x99s were still murky brown.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, now, boys,â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. â\\x80\\x9cA little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTogether they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s vinegar turned to ice; Rons flask exploded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes â\\x80¦ for homework,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, â\\x80\\x9cpractice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a nice day.â\\x80\\x9d Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harryâ\\x80\\x99s brain:\\n\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s Rons sister.\\n\\nBut sheâ\\x80\\x99s ditched Dean!\\n\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s still Rons sister.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m his best mate!\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99ll make it worse.\\n\\nIf I talked to him first â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99d hit you.\\n\\nWhat if I donâ\\x80\\x99t care?\\n\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99s your best mate!\\n\\nHarry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, â\\x80\\x9cKatie! Youâ\\x80\\x99re back! Are you okay?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m really well!â\\x80\\x9d she said happily. â\\x80\\x9cThey let me out of St. Mungos on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cwell, now youâ\\x80\\x99re back and Ronâ\\x80\\x99s fit, weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katieâ\\x80\\x99s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. â\\x80\\x9cEveryoneâ\\x80\\x99s been asking me, but I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 in the Three Broomsticks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou definitely went into the bathroom, then?â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I know I pushed open the door,â\\x80\\x9d said Katie, â\\x80\\x9cso I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memoryâ\\x80\\x99s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungoâ\\x80\\x99s. Listen, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better go, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cto be in the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 bathroom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr someone who looked like a girl or a woman,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to take another swig of Felix,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cand have a go at the Room of Requirement again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat would be a complete waste of potion,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. â\\x80\\x9cLuck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isnâ\\x80\\x99t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Donâ\\x80\\x99t go wasting the rest of that potion! Youâ\\x80\\x99ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d She dropped her voice to a whisper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCouldnâ\\x80\\x99t we make some more?â\\x80\\x9d Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99d be great to have a stock of it. â\\x80¦ Have a look in the bookâ\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nHarry pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlimey, its seriously complicated,â\\x80\\x9d he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. â\\x80\\x9cAnd it takes six months.,. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to let it stew. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTypical,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned â\\x80\\x9cFor Enemies,â\\x80\\x9d that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.\\n\\nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.\\n\\nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.\\n\\nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.\\n\\nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the postLavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ronâ\\x80\\x99s expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . .\\n\\nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around â\\x80\\x94 but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didnâ\\x80\\x99t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good.\\n\\nAll in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, â\\x80\\x9ctweaking the circumstancesâ\\x80\\x9d? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harryâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else.\\n\\nRon was not unique in this respect; interest in the GryffindorRavenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottomofthetable defeat in two centuries.\\n\\nThe runup to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud aftermatch party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.\\n\\nIn the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.\\n\\nA few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventhfloor corridor, checking the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boysâ\\x80\\x99 bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.\\n\\nHarry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.\\n\\nDraco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his whiteblond head bowed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d crooned Moaning Myrtleâ\\x80\\x99s voice from one of the cubicles. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t. . . tell me whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong â\\x80¦ I can help you. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo one can help me,â\\x80\\x9d said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t do it. â\\x80¦ I canâ\\x80\\x99t. â\\x80¦ It wonâ\\x80\\x99t work . . . and unless 1 do it soon â\\x80¦ he says heâ\\x80\\x99ll kill me. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying â\\x80\\x94 actually crying â\\x80\\x94 tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into flucracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder.\\n\\nMalfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo! No! Stop it!â\\x80\\x9d squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. â\\x80\\x9cStop! STOP!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a LegLocker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, â\\x80\\x9cCruci â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSECTUMSEMPRA!â\\x80\\x9d bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.\\n\\nBlood spurted from Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d gasped Harry.\\n\\nSlipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his bloodsoaked chest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo â\\x80\\x94 I didnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: â\\x80\\x9cMURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harryâ\\x80\\x99s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.\\n\\nHarry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he halflifted Malfoy into a standing position.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.. . . Comeâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, â\\x80\\x9cAnd you, Potter . . . You wait here for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment.\\n\\nSnape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo,â\\x80\\x9d he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean it to happen,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what that spell did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Snape ignored this. â\\x80\\x9cApparently I underestimated you, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cWho would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 read about it somewhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was â\\x80\\x94 a library book,â\\x80\\x9d Harry invented wildly. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t remember what it was call â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLiar,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. â\\x80¦\\n\\nThe bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s copy of Advanced PotionMaking swam hazily to the forefront of his mind.\\n\\nAnd then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBring me your schoolbag,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape softly, â\\x80\\x9cand all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed\\n\\nout of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past.\\n\\nHe felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell Slughorn â\\x80\\x94 Harryâ\\x80\\x99s stomach churned â\\x80\\x94 how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not. . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99ve you â\\x80\\x94 ? Why are you soaking â\\x80\\x94 ? Is that blood.â\\x80\\x9d Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at , the sight of Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI need your book,â\\x80\\x9d Harry panted. â\\x80\\x9cYour Potions book. Quick . . . give it to me . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what about the HalfBlood â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll explain later!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRon pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventhfloor corridor.\\n\\nHe skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk.\\n\\nI need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. â\\x80¦\\n\\nThree times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung him self inside, and slammed it shut.\\n\\nHe gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castleproud houseelves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.\\n\\nHarry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboardâ\\x80\\x99s creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the HalfBlood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone.\\n\\nHarry ran flatout toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ronâ\\x80\\x99s copy of Advanced PotionMaking into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harryâ\\x80\\x99s schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited.\\n\\nOne by one, Snape extracted Harrys books and examined them., Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is your copy of Advanced PotionMaking, is it, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, still breathing hard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, with a touch more defiance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the copy of Advanced PotionMaking that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry firmly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why,â\\x80\\x9d asked Snape, â\\x80\\x9cdoes it have the name â\\x80\\x98Roonil Wazlibâ\\x80\\x99 written inside the front cover?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarrys heart missed a beat. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s my nickname,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour nickname,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Snape. ; â\\x80\\x9cYeah . . . thatâ\\x80\\x99s what my friends call me,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand what a nickname is,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind. . . . Close your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to do it properly. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know what I think, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, very quietly. â\\x80\\x9cI think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94 I donâ\\x80\\x99t agree, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, still refusing to look into Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape. â\\x80\\x9cTen oâ\\x80\\x99clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut sir . . .â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, looking up desperately. â\\x80\\x9cQuidditch . . . the last match of the â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTen oâ\\x80\\x99clock,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. â\\x80\\x9cPoor Gryffindor. . . fourth place this year, I fear â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t say â\\x80\\x98I told you so,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, an hour later in the common room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLeave it, Hermione,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron angrily.\\n\\nHarry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,â\\x80\\x9d Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I was right, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t I.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you were,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry stubbornly.\\n\\nHe was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor teamâ\\x80\\x99s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the postmatch euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9chow can you still stick up for that book when that spell â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you stop harping on about the book!â\\x80\\x9d snapped Harry. â\\x80\\x9cThe Prince only copied it out! Itâ\\x80\\x99s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe this,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re actually defendingâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not defending what I did!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. â\\x80\\x9cI wish 1 ; hadnâ\\x80\\x99t done it, and not just because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t've used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you canâ\\x80\\x99t blame the Prince, he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t written â\\x80\\x98try this out, itâ\\x80\\x99s really goodâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94 he was just making notes for himself, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he, not for anyone else. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you telling me,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cthat youâ\\x80\\x99re going to go back â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd get the book? Yeah, I am,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry forcefully. â\\x80\\x9cListen, without the Prince Iâ\\x80\\x99d never have won the Felix Felicis. Iâ\\x80\\x99d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, Iâ\\x80\\x99d never have â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94 got a reputation for Potions brilliance you donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve,â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione nastily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGive it a rest, Hermione!â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. â\\x80\\x9cBy the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, of course Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad Harry wasnâ\\x80\\x99t cursed!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione, clearly stung. â\\x80\\x9cBut you canâ\\x80\\x99t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where itâ\\x80\\x99s landed him! And Iâ\\x80\\x99d have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,â\\x80\\x9d snapped Ginny, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll only embarrass yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however,\\n\\nlittle though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.\\n\\nHis lightheartedness was shortlived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Potter,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape softly. â\\x80\\x9cThey are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRight, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought you could start,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, â\\x80\\x9cwith boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fiftysix. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, â\\x80\\x9cJames Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size. Double detention.â\\x80\\x9d Snape sneered. â\\x80\\x9cIt must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.\\n\\nIt was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Siriusâ\\x80\\x99s names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . .\\n\\nHarry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour â\\x80¦ an hour â\\x80¦ an hour and a half. . . .\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that will do,â\\x80\\x9d he said coldly. â\\x80\\x9cMark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock next Saturday.â\\x80\\x9d Yes, sir.\\n\\nHarry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. â\\x80¦ It was over, then. . . .\\n\\nHe hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuid agis?â\\x80\\x9d he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.\\n\\nHer expression was unreadable as she replied, â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd she swung forward.\\n\\nA roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe won!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. â\\x80\\x9cWe won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.\\n\\nAfter several long moments â\\x80\\x94 or it might have been half an hour â\\x80\\x94 or possibly several sunlit days â\\x80\\x94 they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolfwhistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Wellâ\\x80\\x94if you must.\\n\\nThe creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which â\\x80\\x94 if they had time â\\x80\\x94 they might discuss the match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 25: The Seer Overheard\\n\\n\\nThe fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark magic.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99d think people had better things to gossip about,â\\x80\\x99 said Ginny, as she sat on the commonroom floor, leaning against Harryâ\\x80\\x99s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if itâ\\x80\\x99s true youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What did you tell her?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98 ? told her itâ\\x80\\x99s a Hungarian Horntail,â\\x80\\x99 said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. â\\x80\\x98Much more macho.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThanks,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, grinning. â\\x80\\x98And what did you tell her Ronâ\\x80\\x99s got?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A Pygmy Puff, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t say where.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Watch it,â\\x80\\x99 he said, pointing wamingly at Harry and Ginny. â\\x80\\x98Just because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve given my permission doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean I canâ\\x80\\x99t withdraw it -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTour permissionâ\\x80\\x9d,â\\x80\\x99 scoffed Ginny. â\\x80\\x98Since when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself youâ\\x80\\x99d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, 1 would,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron grudgingly. â\\x80\\x98And just as long as you donâ\\x80\\x99t start snogging each other in public -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place?â\\x80\\x99 demanded Ginny.\\n\\nBut Ronâ\\x80\\x99s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I want to talk to you, Harry.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What about?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.\\n\\nThe socalled HalfBlood Prince.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, not again,â\\x80\\x99 he groaned. â\\x80\\x98Will you please drop it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Princeâ\\x80\\x99s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not dropping it,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione firmly, â\\x80\\x98until youâ\\x80\\x99ve heard me out. Now, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He didnâ\\x80\\x99t make a hobby of it -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He, he - who says itâ\\x80\\x99s a he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ve been through this,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry crossly. â\\x80\\x98Prince, Hermione, Prince!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Right!â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. â\\x80\\x98Look at that! Look at the picture!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey looked at each other and Harry realised what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No way.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You think she was the HalfBlood â\\x80¦? Oh, come on.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, why not? Harry, there arenâ\\x80\\x99t any real princes in the wizarding world! Itâ\\x80\\x99s either a nickname, a madeup title somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard\\n\\nwhose surname was â\\x80\\x9cPrinceâ\\x80\\x9d, and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a â\\x80\\x9chalfblood Princeâ\\x80\\x9d!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen, Hermione, I can tell itâ\\x80\\x99s not a girl. I can just tell.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe truth is that you donâ\\x80\\x99t think a girl would have been clever enough,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione angrily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, stung by this. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasnâ\\x80\\x99t got anything to do with it. Where did you get this, anyway?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The library,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione, predictably. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Enjoy yourself,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry irritably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione. â\\x80\\x98And the first place Iâ\\x80\\x99ll look,â\\x80\\x99 she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, â\\x80\\x98is records of old Potions awards!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sheâ\\x80\\x99s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron, returning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You donâ\\x80\\x99t think Iâ\\x80\\x99m mad, wanting that book back, do you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Course not,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron robustly. â\\x80\\x98He was a genius, the Prince. Anyway â\\x80¦ without his bezoar tip â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99 he drew his finger significantly across his own throat, â\\x80\\x98I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nor am I,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry quickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But he healed all right, didnâ\\x80\\x99t he? Back on his feet in no time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same. Thanks to Snape â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?â\\x80\\x99 Ron continued.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,â\\x80\\x99 sighed Harry. â\\x80\\x98And heâ\\x80\\x99s hinting now that if I donâ\\x80\\x99t get all the boxes done by the end of term, weâ\\x80\\x99ll carry on next year.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.\\n\\nHarry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thanks, Jimmy â\\x80¦ hey, itâ\\x80\\x99s from Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x99 said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. â\\x80\\x98He wants me to go to his office as quick as 1 can!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey stared at each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Blimey,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Ron. â\\x80\\x98You donâ\\x80\\x99t reckon â\\x80¦ he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t found â\\x80¦?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Better go and see, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, jumping to his feet.\\n\\nHe hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harryâ\\x80\\x99s defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.\\n\\nAnd then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How - dare - you - aaaaargh!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready, hurtled round another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Professor -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry hurried forwards and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s helping arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What happened, Professor?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You may well ask!â\\x80\\x99 she said shrilly. â\\x80\\x98I was strolling along, brooding upon certain Dark portents 1 happen to have glimpsed â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: there on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and, on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ omens I have been vouchsafed - what?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe looked suddenly shifty.\\n\\nThe Room of Requirement,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Harry. â\\x80\\x98Were you trying to get in there?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I - well - I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know students knew about -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not all of them do,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98But what happened? You screamed â\\x80¦ it sounded as though you were hurtâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I - well,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. â\\x80\\x98I wished to - ah - deposit certain â\\x80\\x93 um - personal items in the Room â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99 And she muttered something about â\\x80\\x98nasty accusationsâ\\x80\\x99.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Right,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. â\\x80\\x98But you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get in and hide them?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the HalfBlood Princeâ\\x80\\x99s book.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, I got in all right,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. â\\x80\\x98But there was somebody already in there.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Somebody in -? Who?â\\x80\\x99 demanded Harry. â\\x80\\x98Who was in there?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98 ? have no idea,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s voice. â\\x80\\x98I walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding - of using the Room, I mean.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A voice? Saying what?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that it was saying anything,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney. â\\x80\\x98It was â\\x80¦ whooping.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whooping?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Gleefully,â\\x80\\x99 she said, nodding.\\n\\nHarry stared at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Was it male or female?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98 ? would hazard a guess at male,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And it sounded happy?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very happy,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney sniffily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As though it was celebrating?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Most definitely.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And then -?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And then I called out, â\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s there?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have found out who it was without asking?â\\x80\\x99 Harry asked her, slightly frustrated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The Inner Eye,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, â\\x80\\x98was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Right,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawneyâ\\x80\\x99s Inner Eye all too often before. â\\x80\\x98And did the voice say who was there?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, it did not,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you didnâ\\x80\\x99t see that coming?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, unable to help himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -â\\x80\\x99 She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I think youâ\\x80\\x99d better tell Professor Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98He ought to know Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s celebrating - I mean, that someone threw you out of the Room.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTo his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.\\n\\nThe Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,â\\x80\\x99 she said coldly. I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHer bony hand closed suddenly around Harryâ\\x80\\x99s wrist.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Again and again, no matter how I lay them out -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- the lightningstruck tower,â\\x80\\x99 she whispered. â\\x80\\x98Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Right,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry again. â\\x80\\x98Well â\\x80¦ I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You think so?â\\x80\\x99 Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to see him right now,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a meeting with him. We could go together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, well, in that case,â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I miss having you in my classes, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 she said soulfully, as they set off together. â\\x80\\x98You were never much of a Seer â\\x80¦ but you were a wonderful Objectâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawneyâ\\x80\\x99s continual predictions of doom.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am afraid,â\\x80\\x99 she went on, â\\x80\\x98that the nag - Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHer voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my greatgreatgrandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry mumbled something indistinct.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x99 went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. â\\x80\\x98He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed â\\x80¦ I was staying at the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Head, which I do not advise, incidentally - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me â\\x80¦ I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed illdisposed towards Divination â\\x80¦ and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day â\\x80¦ but then â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore - you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Harry, dear?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe looked back over her shoulder, having only just realised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry?â\\x80\\x99 she repeated uncertainly.\\n\\nPerhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stockstill as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long â\\x80¦\\n\\nIt was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son â\\x80¦\\n\\nNothing else mattered to Harry just now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry?â\\x80\\x99 said Professor Trelawney again. â\\x80\\x98Harry - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You stay here,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry through numb lips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, dear â\\x80¦ I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You stay here!â\\x80\\x99 Harry repeated angrily.\\n\\nShe looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered â\\x80\\x98Enterâ\\x80\\x99 after Harry had already flung himself into the room.\\n\\nFawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window. Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black travelling cloak in his arms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come â\\x80¦ with you â\\x80¦ ?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Only if you wish it, of course.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If Iâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office in the first place.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ve found one? Youâ\\x80\\x99ve found a Horcrux?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I believe so.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Harry could not speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is natural to be afraid,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not scared!â\\x80\\x99 said Harry at once, and it was perfectly\\n\\ntrue; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. â\\x80\\x98Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am not sure which it is - though I think we can rule out the snake - but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98How is it protected?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.â\\x80\\x99 Dumbledore hesitated, then said, â\\x80\\x98Harry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window, and looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What has happened to you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nothing,â\\x80\\x99 lied Harry promptly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What has upset you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not upset.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry, you were never a good Occlumens -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe word was the spark that ignited Harryâ\\x80\\x99s fury.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Snape!â\\x80\\x99 he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. â\\x80\\x98Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98When did you find out about this?â\\x80\\x99 he asked at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just now!â\\x80\\x99 said Many, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. â\\x80\\x98AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBreathing hard as though he were fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x98Please listen to me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s lined face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Professor Snape made a terrible -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Please let me finish.â\\x80\\x99 Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on. â\\x80\\x98Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawneyâ\\x80\\x99s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know - he had no possible way of knowing - which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Havenâ\\x80\\x99t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realised how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But heâ\\x80\\x99s a very good Occlumens, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he, sir?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. â\\x80\\x98And isnâ\\x80\\x99t Voldemort convinced that Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s on his side, even now? Professor â\\x80¦ how can you be sure Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s on our side?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, â\\x80\\x98I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, I donâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x99 he said, as loudly as before. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We have discussed this, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. â\\x80\\x98I have told you my views.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re leaving the school tonight and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll bet you havenâ\\x80\\x99t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTo what?â\\x80\\x99 asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. â\\x80\\x98What is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I â\\x80¦ theyâ\\x80\\x99re up to something!â\\x80\\x99 said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. â\\x80\\x98Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! Heâ\\x80\\x99s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me heâ\\x80\\x99s fixed it at last and youâ\\x80\\x99re about to just walk out of school * without -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Enough,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. â\\x80\\x98Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I didnâ\\x80\\x99t -â\\x80\\x99 mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98 ? do not wish to discuss the matter any further.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, â\\x80\\x98Do you wish to come with me tonight?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very well, then: listen.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledore drew himself up to his full height.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Of course.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such orders as â\\x80\\x9crunâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9chideâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cgo backâ\\x80\\x9d. Do I have your word?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I - yes, of course.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If 1 tell you to hide, you will do so?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If I tell you to flee, you will obey?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey looked at each other for a moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, sir.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutesâ\\x80\\x99 time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a rubyred glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.\\n\\nRon and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. â\\x80\\x98What does Dumbledore want?â\\x80\\x99 Hermione said at once. â\\x80\\x98Harry, are you OK?â\\x80\\x99 she added anxiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m fine,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map and a pair of balledup socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got much time,â\\x80\\x99 Harry panted, â\\x80\\x98Dumbledore thinks Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nQuickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s gasps of horror or for Ronâ\\x80\\x99s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ so you see what this means?â\\x80\\x99 Harry finished at a gallop. â\\x80\\x98Dumbledore wonâ\\x80\\x99t be here tonight, so Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s going to have another clear shot at whatever heâ\\x80\\x99s up to. No, listen to me!â\\x80\\x9d he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. â\\x80\\x98I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here -â\\x80\\x99 He shoved the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map into Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s hand. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to watch him and youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says heâ\\x80\\x99s put extra protection in the school, but if Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s involved, heâ\\x80\\x99ll know what Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s protection is, and how to avoid it - but he wonâ\\x80\\x99t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry -â\\x80\\x99 began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98 ? havenâ\\x80\\x99t got time to argue,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry curtly. Take this as well -â\\x80\\x99 He thrust the socks into Ronâ\\x80\\x99s hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thanks,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron. â\\x80\\x98Er - why do I need socks?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You need whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrapped in them, itâ\\x80\\x99s the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say goodbye to her from me. Iâ\\x80\\x99d better go, Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s waiting -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No!â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. â\\x80\\x98We donâ\\x80\\x99t want it, you take it, who knows what youâ\\x80\\x99re going to be facing?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99Il be fine, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be with Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98I want to know you lot are OK â\\x80¦ donâ\\x80\\x99t look like that, Hermione, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you later\\n\\nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall.\\n\\nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, â\\x80\\x98Very good. Shall we go?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?â\\x80\\x99 Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape.\\n\\nThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore lightly. â\\x80\\x98I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Head â\\x80¦ or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising oneâ\\x80\\x99s true destination.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Professor,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, â\\x80\\x98will we be Apparating?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98You can Apparate now, I believe?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, â\\x80\\x98but I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got a licence.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No matter,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x98I can assist you again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- and stay out!â\\x80\\x99 shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubbylooking wizard. â\\x80\\x98Oh, hello, Albus â\\x80¦ youâ\\x80\\x99re out late â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening â\\x80¦ forgive me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m off to the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Head â\\x80¦ no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonightâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nA minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Headâ\\x80\\x99s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It will not be necessary for us to enter,â\\x80\\x99 muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. â\\x80\\x98As long as nobody sees us go â\\x80¦ now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three - one â\\x80¦ two â\\x80¦ three â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 26: The Cave\\n\\n\\nHarry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and starstrewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harryâ\\x80\\x99s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey brought the kids from the orphanage here?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot here, precisely,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut his final destination â\\x80\\x94 and ours â\\x80\\x94 lies a little farther on. Come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay halfsubmerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. â\\x80\\x9cLumos,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. â\\x80\\x9cYou see?â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. â\\x80\\x9cYou will not object to getting a little wet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen take off your Invisibility Cloak â\\x80\\x94 there is no need for it now â\\x80\\x94 and let us take the plunge,â\\x80\\x9d And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Harryâ\\x80\\x99s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.\\n\\nThen he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.\\n\\nDumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, this is the place,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow can you tell?â\\x80\\x9d Harry spoke in a whisper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt has known magic,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore simply. Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spinedeep coldness or to the same awareness of\\n\\nenchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. â\\x80\\x9cThis is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore after a moment or two. â\\x80\\x9cWe need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. â\\x80\\x9cHere,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWe go on through here. The entrance is concealed.â\\x80\\x9d Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve ddone it!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, Iâ\\x80\\x99m so sorry, I forgot,â\\x80\\x9d he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harryâ\\x80\\x99s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledores concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, â\\x80\\x9cOh, surely not. So crude.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, Professor?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI rather think,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, â\\x80\\x9cthat we are required to make payment to pass.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPayment?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve got to give the door something?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cBlood, if I am not much mistaken.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlood?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI said it was crude,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected. â\\x80\\x9cThe idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes, however, it is unavoidable,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor!â\\x80\\x9d protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do it, Iâ\\x80\\x99m â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He did not know what he was going to say â\\x80\\x94 younger, fitter?\\n\\nBut Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s wound, â\\x80\\x9cBut your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The bloodspattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. â\\x80\\x9cAfter me, I think,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.\\n\\nAn eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us walk,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x9cBe very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.â\\x80\\x9d He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor?â\\x80\\x9d he said finally. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think the Horcrux is here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe couldnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80¦ we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t just try a Summoning Charm?â\\x80\\x9d Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly we could,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you do it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe? Oh . . . okay . . .â\\x80\\x9d Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, â\\x80\\x9cAccio Horcrux!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomething, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart, however, was still pounding.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you think that would happen, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut we donâ\\x80\\x99t know what the thing was,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat the things are, you mean,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to go into the lake?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInto it? Only if we are very unfortunate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no â\\x80¦ I think the Horcrux is in the middle.â\\x80\\x9d And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo weâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I think so.â\\x80\\x9d Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. â\\x80\\x9cSo sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOho,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.\\n\\nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you know that was there?â\\x80\\x9d Harry asked in astonishment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMagic always leaves traces,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, â\\x80\\x9csometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs â\\x80¦ is this boat safe?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo the things in the water wonâ\\x80\\x99t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s boat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why have they let us?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVoldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. â\\x80\\x9cIt doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore chuckled. â\\x80\\x9cVoldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut then â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteenyearold to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.â\\x80\\x9d These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, â\\x80\\x9cVoldemortâ\\x80\\x99s mistake, Harry, Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boatâ\\x80\\x99s prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.\\n\\nHarry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . .\\n\\nAnd then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor!â\\x80\\x9d he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think I saw a hand in the water â\\x80\\x94 a human hand!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I am sure you did,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly.\\n\\nHarry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that thing that jumped out of the water â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. â\\x80\\x9cThere are bodies in here!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore placidly, â\\x80\\x9cbut we do not need to worry about them at the moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt the moment?â\\x80\\x9d Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.â\\x80\\x9d Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut one of them jumped,â\\x80\\x9d he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cI am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s bewildered expression.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh . . . right. . .â\\x80\\x9d said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead â\\x80¦ It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to them . . . and he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen Ginny at all. . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNearly there,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. â\\x80\\x9cCareful not to touch the water,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat.\\n\\nThe island was no larger than Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cSomething more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, no, donâ\\x80\\x99t touch â\\x80\\x94 !â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot touch,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. â\\x80\\x9cSee? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut of the way, please, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of thepotion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think the Horcrux is in there, sir?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes.â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. â\\x80\\x9cBut how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.â\\x80\\x9d Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. â\\x80\\x9cI can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what ifâ\\x80\\x94 what if it kills you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I doubt that it would work like that,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore easily. â\\x80\\x9cLord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.â\\x80\\x9d Harry couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it. Was this more of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s insane determination to see good in everyone?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, â\\x80\\x9csir, this is Voldemort weâ\\x80\\x99re â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore corrected himself. â\\x80\\x9cHe would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. â\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly,â\\x80\\x9d he said, finally, â\\x80\\x9cthis potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTheir eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along â\\x80\\x94 so that he could forcefeed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou remember,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cthe condition on which I brought you with me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what ifâ\\x80\\x94?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbut â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, â\\x80\\x9cyou have my orders.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy canâ\\x80\\x99t I drink the potion instead?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry desperately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x9cOnce and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCouldnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo I have it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour word, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI â\\x80\\x94all right, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBefore Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. â\\x80\\x9cYour good health, Harry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor?â\\x80\\x9d he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. â\\x80\\x9cHow do you feel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.\\n\\nIn silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, his voice strained. â\\x80\\x9cCan you hear me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor, can you hear me?â\\x80\\x9d he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern.\\n\\nDumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want. . . Donâ\\x80\\x99t make me â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and halfmoon spectacles, and did not know what to do.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c. . . donâ\\x80\\x99t like . . . want to stop . . .â\\x80\\x9d moaned Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou . . . you canâ\\x80\\x99t stop, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . .â\\x80\\x9d Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to. â\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to. . . . Let me go. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIts all right, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, his hand shaking. â\\x80\\x9cIts all right, Iâ\\x80\\x99m here â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMake it stop, make it stop,â\\x80\\x9d moaned Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.. . yes, thisâ\\x80\\x99ll make it stop,â\\x80\\x9d lied Harry. He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s open mouth. Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no, no, I canâ\\x80\\x99t, I canâ\\x80\\x99t, donâ\\x80\\x99t make me, I donâ\\x80\\x99t warn to. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all right, Professor, itâ\\x80\\x99s all right!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth goblei ful of potion; the basin was now half empty. â\\x80\\x9cNothingâ\\x80\\x99s happening to you, youâ\\x80\\x99re safe, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t real, I swear it isnâ\\x80\\x99t real â\\x80\\x94 take this, now, take thisâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIts all my fault, all my fault,â\\x80\\x9d he sobbed. â\\x80\\x9cPlease make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never, never again â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis will make it stop, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said, his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s mouth.\\n\\nDumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harryâ\\x80\\x99s trembling hands as he moaned, â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t hurt them, donâ\\x80\\x99t hurt them, please, please, its my fault, hurt me instead â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere, drink this, drink this, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be all right,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlease, please, please, no â\\x80¦ not that, not that, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do anything â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust drink, Professor, just drink . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. â\\x80\\x9cNo more, please, no more â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe supported Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, â\\x80\\x9cI want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDrink this, Professor. Drink this. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, â\\x80\\x9cKILL ME!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis â\\x80\\x94 this one will!â\\x80\\x9d gasped Harry. â\\x80\\x9cJust drink this .. . Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be over â\\x80¦ all over!â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x9cno, youâ\\x80\\x99re not dead, you said it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t poison, wake up, wake up â\\x80\\x94 Rennervate!â\\x80\\x9d he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledores chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. â\\x80\\x9cRennervate â\\x80\\x94 sir â\\x80\\x94 please â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledores eyelids flickered; Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart leapt, â\\x80\\x9cSir, are you â\\x80\\x94 ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWater,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWater,â\\x80\\x9d panted Harry. â\\x80\\x9cYes â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAguamenti!â\\x80\\x9d he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand. The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips â\\x80\\x94 but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. â\\x80\\x9cBut I had some â\\x80\\x94 wait â\\x80\\x94 Aguamenti!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledores mouth, the water vanished again. â\\x80\\x9cSir, Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying, Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. â\\x80\\x9cAguamenti â\\x80\\x94Aguamenti â\\x80\\x94AGUAMENTI!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledores breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so â\\x80¦ He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish. â\\x80\\x9cSir â\\x80\\x94 here!â\\x80\\x9d Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face.\\n\\nIt was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirrorsmooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!â\\x80\\x9d Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. â\\x80\\x9cImpedimenta! Incarcerous!â\\x80\\x9d A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, â\\x80\\x9cSectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!â\\x80\\x9d But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soulâ\\x80¦\\n\\nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around.\\n\\nDumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . .\\n\\nDumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.\\n\\nHarry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d panted Harry, â\\x80\\x9csir, I forgot â\\x80\\x94 about fire â\\x80\\x94 they were coming at me and I panicked â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite understandable,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.\\n\\nThey reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am weakâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t worry, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t worry, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd pulling Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe protection was . . . after allâ\\x80¦ welldesigned,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore faintly. â\\x80\\x9cOne alone could not have done it. â\\x80¦ You did well, very well, Harry. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t talk now,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s voice had become, how much his feet dragged. â\\x80\\x9cSave your energy, sir. . . . Weâ\\x80\\x99ll soon be out of here. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x98\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no need, I got cut on the rock,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry firmly. â\\x80\\x9cJust tell me where. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having received its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s going to be all right, sir,â\\x80\\x9d Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s silence than he had been by his weakened voice. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re nearly there. â\\x80¦ I can Apparate us both back . . . Donâ\\x80\\x99t worry. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not worried, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. â\\x80\\x9cI am with you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\\n\\n\\nOnce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s weight still upon him, Harry con centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression.\\n\\nHe knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harryâ\\x80\\x99s imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We did it, Professor!â\\x80\\x99 Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. â\\x80\\x98We did it! We got the Horcrux!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore offbalance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sir, are you all right?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been better,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion â\\x80¦ was no health drink â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sir - itâ\\x80\\x99s OK, sir, youâ\\x80\\x99re going to be all right, donâ\\x80\\x99t worry -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We need to get you up to the school, sir â\\x80¦ Madam Pomfrey â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98It is â\\x80¦ Professor Snape whom I need â\\x80¦ but I do not think â\\x80¦ I can walk very far just yet â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Right - sir, listen - Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Severus,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore clearly. â\\x80\\x98I need Severus â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right then, Snape - but Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBefore Harry could make a move, however, he heard run ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on highheeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressinggown embroidered with dragons.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t think what to - but whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong with Albus?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wideeyed, at Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s hurt,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You canâ\\x80\\x99t go up there alone! Donâ\\x80\\x99t you realise - havenâ\\x80\\x99t you seen -?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you help me support him,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, not listening to her, â\\x80\\x98I think we can get him inside -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What has happened?â\\x80\\x99 asked Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Rosmerta, whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe - the Dark Mark, Albus.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words â\\x80¦ he turned and looked.\\n\\nThere it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building â\\x80¦ wherever they had murdered â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98When did it appear?â\\x80\\x99 asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harryâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Must have been minutes ago, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We need to return to the castle at once,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Rosmerta,â\\x80\\x99 and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, â\\x80\\x98we need transport - brooms -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a couple behind the bar,â\\x80\\x99 she said, looking very frightened. â\\x80\\x98Shall I run and fetch -?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, Harry can do it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry raised his wand at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Accio Rosmertaâ\\x80\\x99s brooms.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nA second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. â\\x80\\x98It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong â\\x80¦ Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind â\\x80¦\\n\\nHow long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the DA? And if it was â\\x80¦ he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds â\\x80¦ would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?\\n\\nAs they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?\\n\\nDumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around.\\n\\nThe ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What does it mean?â\\x80\\x99 Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpentâ\\x80\\x99s tongue glinting evilly above them. â\\x80\\x98Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been - Professor?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Go and wake Severus,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do noth ing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You swore to obey me, Harry - go!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.\\n\\nThe door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: â\\x80\\x98Expelliarmus!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm -\\n\\nThen, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood â\\x80¦ Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.\\n\\nStanding against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, â\\x80\\x98Good evening, Draco.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who else is here?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A question 1 might ask you. Or are you acting alone?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry saw Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, well,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was show ing him an ambitious homework project. â\\x80\\x98Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, who was panting. â\\x80\\x98Right under your nose and you never realised!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ingenious,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Yet â\\x80¦ forgive me â\\x80¦ where are they now? You seem unsupported.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey met some of your guard. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re having a fight down below. They wonâ\\x80\\x99t be long â\\x80¦ I came on ahead. I - Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a job to do.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore softly.\\n\\nThere was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eatersâ\\x80\\x99 distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How do you know?â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy at once.\\n\\nHe seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Markâ\\x80\\x99s greenish light.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You donâ\\x80\\x99t know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m capable of,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy more forcefully, â\\x80\\x98you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, yes, I do,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore mildly. â\\x80\\x98You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts â\\x80¦ so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in itâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It has been in it!â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy vehemently. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been work ing on it all year, and tonight -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSomewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Somebody is putting up a good fight,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore conversationally. â\\x80\\x98But you were saying â\\x80¦ yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible â\\x80¦ how did you do it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,â\\x80\\x99 suggested Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you donâ\\x80\\x99t really need help â\\x80¦ I have no wand at the moment â\\x80¦ I cannot defend myself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy merely stared at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I see,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither\\n\\nmoved nor spoke. â\\x80\\x98You are afraid to act until they join\\n\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99Â»\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not afraid!â\\x80\\x99 snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s you who should be scared!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But why? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe â\\x80¦ so tell me, while we wait for your friends â\\x80¦ how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latterâ\\x80\\x99s heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, â\\x80\\x981 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no oneâ\\x80\\x99s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Aaaah.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment.\\n\\nThat was clever â\\x80¦ there is a pair, I take it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The otherâ\\x80\\x99s in Borgin and Burkes,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, â\\x80\\x98and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was travelling between them, but he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make anyone hear him â\\x80¦ in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though heâ\\x80\\x99d never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin didnâ\\x80\\x99t know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very good,â\\x80\\x99 murmured Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you â\\x80¦ a clever plan, a very clever plan â\\x80¦ and, as you say, right under my nose â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s praise. â\\x80\\x98Yeah, it was!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But there were times,â\\x80\\x99 Dumbledore went on, â\\x80\\x98werenâ\\x80\\x99t there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands â\\x80¦ poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, well, you still didnâ\\x80\\x99t realise who was behind that stuff, did you?â\\x80\\x99 sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As a matter of fact, I did,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98I was sure it was you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you stop me, then?â\\x80\\x99 Malfoy demanded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been doing your orders, he promised my mother -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s a doubleagent, you stupid old man, he isnâ\\x80\\x99t working for you, you just think he is!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, youâ\\x80\\x99re losing your grip, then!â\\x80\\x99 sneered Malfoy. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the action - â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything -â\\x80\\x9d But I havenâ\\x80\\x99t told him what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, heâ\\x80\\x99s going to wake up tomorrow and itâ\\x80\\x99ll all be over and he wonâ\\x80\\x99t be the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s favourite any more, heâ\\x80\\x99ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very gratifying,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore mildly. â\\x80\\x98We all like* appreciation for our own hard work, of course â\\x80¦ but you must have had an accomplice, all the same â\\x80¦ someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah\\n\\nDumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ of course â\\x80¦ Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Got there at last, have you?â\\x80\\x99 Malfoy taunted.\\n\\nThere was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, â\\x80\\x98So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead â\\x80¦ well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present â\\x80¦ yes, very neat â\\x80¦ very neat â\\x80¦ poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmertaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦ tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Enchanted coins,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. â\\x80\\x98I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s Army used last year?â\\x80\\x99 asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, I got the idea from them,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. â\\x80\\x98I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah\\n\\nDumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ of course â\\x80¦ Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Got there at last, have you?â\\x80\\x99 Malfoy taunted.\\n\\nThere was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, â\\x80\\x98So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead â\\x80¦ well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present â\\x80¦ yes, very neat â\\x80¦ very neat â\\x80¦ poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmertaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦ tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Enchanted coins,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. â\\x80\\x98I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s Army used last year?â\\x80\\x99 asked Dumbledore.

We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoyâ\\x80\\x99s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now, about tonight,â\\x80\\x99 Dumbledore went on, â\\x80\\x98I am a little puzzled about how it happened â\\x80¦ you knew that I had left the school? But of course,â\\x80\\x99 he answered his own question, â\\x80\\x98Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy. â\\x80\\x98But she said you were just going for a drink, youâ\\x80\\x99d be back â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, I certainly did have a drink â\\x80¦ and I came back â\\x80¦ after a fashion,â\\x80\\x99 mumbled Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98So you decided to spring a trap for me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see whoâ\\x80\\x99d been killed,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy. â\\x80\\x98And it worked!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well â\\x80¦ yes and no â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Someoneâ\\x80\\x99s dead,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. â\\x80\\x98One of your people â\\x80¦ I donâ\\x80\\x99t know who, it was dark â\\x80¦ I stepped over the body â\\x80¦ I was* supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, they do that,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore.\\n\\nThere was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest â\\x80¦ someone was dead â\\x80¦ Malfoy had stepped over the body â\\x80¦ but who was it?\\n\\nThere is little time, one way or another,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98So let us discuss your options, Draco.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My options!â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy loudly. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m standing here with a wand - Iâ\\x80\\x99m about to kill you -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I havenâ\\x80\\x99t got any options!â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, and he was sud denly as white as Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to do it! Heâ\\x80\\x99ll kill me! Heâ\\x80\\x99ll kill my whole family!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I appreciate the difficulty of your position,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy winced at the sound of the name.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,â\\x80\\x99 continued Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98But now at last we can speak plainly to each other â\\x80¦ no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived â\\x80¦ I can help you, Draco.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, you canâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x99 said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. â\\x80\\x98Nobody can. He told me to do it or heâ\\x80\\x99ll kill me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got no choice.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban â\\x80¦ when the time comes we can protect him too â\\x80¦ come over to the right side, Draco â\\x80¦ you are not a killer â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy stared at Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But I got this far, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x99 he said slowly. They thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d die in the attempt, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m here â\\x80¦ and youâ\\x80\\x99re in my power â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99m the one with the wand â\\x80¦ youâ\\x80\\x99re at my mercy â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, Draco,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore quietly. â\\x80\\x98It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction -\\n\\nBut suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ramparts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.\\n\\nA lumpylooking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dumbledore cornered!â\\x80\\x99 he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. â\\x80\\x98Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good evening, Amycus,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. â\\x80\\x98And youâ\\x80\\x99ve brought Alecto too â\\x80¦ charming â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe woman gave an angry little titter.\\n\\nThink your little jokesâ\\x80\\x99ll help you on your death bed, then?â\\x80\\x99 she jeered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Jokes? No, no, these are manners,â\\x80\\x99 replied Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do it,â\\x80\\x99 said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eaterâ\\x80\\x99s robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is that you, Fenrir?â\\x80\\x99 asked Dumbledore.\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x99 rasped the other. â\\x80\\x98Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, I cannot say that I am â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual â\\x80¦ you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s right,â\\x80\\x99 said Greyback. â\\x80\\x98Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends liveâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x99 breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. â\\x80\\x98I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know he was going to come -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x99 rasped Greyback. â\\x80\\x98Not when there are throats to be ripped out â\\x80¦ delicious, delicious â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x981 could do you for afters, Dumbledore â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutallooking face. â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got orders. Dracoâ\\x80\\x99s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!â\\x80\\x99 said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s wheezing giggles. â\\x80\\x98Look at him - whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened to you, then, Dumby?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,â\\x80\\x99 said Dumbledore. â\\x80\\x98Old age, in short â\\x80¦ one day, perhaps, it will happen to you â\\x80¦ if you are lucky â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s that mean, then, whatâ\\x80\\x99s that mean?â\\x80\\x99 yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. â\\x80\\x98Always the same, werenâ\\x80\\x99t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I donâ\\x80\\x99t even know why the Dark Lordâ\\x80\\x99s bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, â\\x80\\x98Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now, Draco, quickly!â\\x80\\x99 said the brutalfaced man angrily.\\n\\nBut Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.\\n\\nTil do it,â\\x80\\x99 snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I said no!â\\x80\\x99 shouted the brutalfaced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us -â\\x80\\x99 screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got a problem, Snape,â\\x80\\x99 said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, â\\x80\\x98the boy doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem able -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut somebody else had spoken Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s name, quite softly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Severus â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.\\n\\nSnape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.\\n\\nSnape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Severus â\\x80¦ please â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Avada Kedavra!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nA jet of green light shot from the end of Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 28: Flight of the Prince\\n\\n\\nHarry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut of here, quickly,â\\x80\\x9d said Snape.\\n\\nHe seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutalfaced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.\\n\\nTerror tore at Harry;s heart. â\\x80¦ He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. â\\x80¦ Somehow the two things were linked. â\\x80¦ He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. â\\x80¦ Dumbledore could not have died. â\\x80¦\\n\\nHe leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s over, time to go!â\\x80\\x9d and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: â\\x80\\x9cCrucio - Crucio - you canâ\\x80\\x99t dance forever, pretty-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpedimenta!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry.\\n\\nHis jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, where did you come from?â\\x80\\x9d Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTake that!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someoneâ\\x80\\x99s legs. Looking around, he saw Nevilleâ\\x80\\x99s pale, round face flat against the floor. â\\x80\\x9cNeville, are you - ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMâ\\x80\\x99all right,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, â\\x80\\x9cHarry . . . Snape â\\x80\\x98nâ\\x80\\x99 Malfoy . . . ran past. . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, Iâ\\x80\\x99m on it!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .\\n\\nHe skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -\\n\\nHe skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .\\n\\nHe pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajamaclad Hufflepuffs stood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -â\\x80\\x9d began Ernie Macmillan.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut of the way!â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.\\n\\nHarry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. â\\x80¦\\n\\nThe cold night air ripped at Harryâ\\x80\\x99s lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -\\n\\nAnother flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . .\\n\\nSomething caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpedimenta!â\\x80\\x9d he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.\\n\\nAnd now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -\\n\\nHarry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s back, and yelled, â\\x80\\x9cStupefy!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe missed; the jet of red light soared past Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s head; Snape shouted, â\\x80\\x9cRun, Draco!â\\x80\\x9dand turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCruc - â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nBut Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, â\\x80\\x9cIncendio!â\\x80\\x9d Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s house was on fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFangâ\\x80\\x99s in there, yer evil - !â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid bellowed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCruc -â\\x80\\x9d yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!â\\x80\\x9d he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. â\\x80\\x9cYou havenâ\\x80\\x99t got the nerve or the ability -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIncarc-â\\x80\\x9cHarry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFight back!â\\x80\\x9d Harry screamed at him. â\\x80\\x9cFight back, you cowardlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCoward, did you call me, Potter?â\\x80\\x9d shouted Snape. â\\x80\\x9cYour father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cStupe-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!â\\x80\\x9d sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. â\\x80\\x9cNow come!â\\x80\\x9d he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. â\\x80\\x9cIt is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpedi -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nBut before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d roared Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, â\\x80\\x9cHave you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSectum - â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nSnape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Potter!â\\x80\\x9d screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\\\\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the HalfBlood Prince! And youâ\\x80\\x99d turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so . . . noâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKill me then,â\\x80\\x9d panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. â\\x80\\x9cKill me like you killed him, you coward -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDONâ\\x80\\x99T -â\\x80\\x9d screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - â\\x80\\x9cCALL ME COWARD!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he slashed at the air: Harry felt a whitehot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razorsharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -\\n\\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the schoolâ\\x80\\x99s boundaries.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. â\\x80\\x9cHAGRID?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeh all righâ\\x80\\x99, Harry? Yeh all righâ\\x80\\x99? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fangâ\\x80\\x99s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m all right,â\\x80\\x9d panted Harry. â\\x80\\x9cAre you?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Course I am . . . take moreâ\\x80\\x99n that ter finish me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid put his hands under Harryâ\\x80\\x99s arms and raised him up with such force that Harryâ\\x80\\x99s feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe should put out your house,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cthe charmâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Aguamentiâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKnew it was summat like that,â\\x80\\x9d mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, â\\x80\\x9cAguamenti!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured â\\x80\\x9cAguamentiâ\\x80\\x9d too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSâ\\x80\\x99not too bad,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. â\\x80\\x9cNothin Dumbledore wonâ\\x80\\x99 be able to put righâ\\x80\\x99 . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was bindinâ\\x80\\x99 up a couple oâ\\x80\\x99 bowtruckle legs when I heard â\\x80\\x98em coming,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what happened, Harry? I jusâ\\x80\\x99 saw them Death Eaters runnin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doinâ\\x80\\x99 with â\\x80\\x98em? Whereâ\\x80\\x99s he gone - was he chasinâ\\x80\\x99 them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe . . .â\\x80\\x9d Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. â\\x80\\x9cHagrid, he killed . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKilled?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSnape killed? Whatâ\\x80\\x99re yeh on abouâ\\x80\\x99, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSnape killed .. . Dumbledore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore wha, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s dead. Snape killed himâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99 say that,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid roughly. â\\x80\\x9cSnape kill Dumbledore - donâ\\x80\\x99 be stupid, Harry. Whaâ\\x80\\x99s made yeh say thaâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw it happen.â\\x80\\x9d , ,..\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeh couldnâ\\x80\\x99 have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw it, Hagrid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid said confidently. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose heâ\\x80\\x99s gotta keep his cover. Look, letâ\\x80\\x99s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. â\\x80¦ As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .\\n\\nThe oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressinggowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought\\n\\nDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99re they all lookinâ\\x80\\x99 at?â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. â\\x80\\x9cWhaâ\\x80\\x99s that lyinâ\\x80\\x99 on the grass?â\\x80\\x9d Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. â\\x80\\x9cSee it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh donâ\\x80\\x99 think someone got thrown - ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .\\n\\nHe and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.\\n\\nHarry heard Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full BodyBind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spreadeagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.\\n\\nDumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the halfmoon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he helpâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93\\n\\nThe crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.\\n\\nThe locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrongâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93\\n\\nHe turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.\\n\\nAutomatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:\\n\\nTo the Dark Lord\\n\\nI now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\\n\\nI face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.\\n\\nR.A.B.\\n\\nHarry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 29: The Pheonix Lament\\n\\n\\nC â\\x80\\x98mere, Harry â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeh canâ\\x80\\x99 stay here, Harry. â\\x80¦ Come on, nowâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe did not want to leave Dumbledores side, he did not want to move anywhere. Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, â\\x80\\x9cHarry, come on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to the hospital wing,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not hurt,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. !\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s McGonagalls orders,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cEveryoneâ\\x80\\x99s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nFear stirred in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGinny, who else is dead?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t worry, none of us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the Dark Mark - Malfoy said he stepped over a body -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe stepped over Bill, but its all right, heâ\\x80\\x99s alive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you sure?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure . . . heâ\\x80\\x99s a - a bit of a mess, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he wonâ\\x80\\x99t - wonâ\\x80\\x99t look the same anymore. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGinnyâ\\x80\\x99s voice trembled a little.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t really know what the aftereffects will be - I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be all right. And a Death Eaterâ\\x80\\x99s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere - Harry, if we hadnâ\\x80\\x99t had your Felix potion, I think weâ\\x80\\x99d all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nThey had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you all right, Harry?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m fineâ\\x80¦. Howâ\\x80\\x99s Bill?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNobody answered. Harry looked over Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Billâ\\x80\\x99s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harshsmelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t you fix them with a charm or something?â\\x80\\x9d he asked the matron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo charm will work on these,â\\x80\\x9d said Madam Pomfrey. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t bitten at the full moon,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, who was gazing down into his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. â\\x80\\x9cGreyback hadnâ\\x80\\x99t transformed, so surely Bill wonâ\\x80\\x99t be a - a real - ?â\\x80\\x9d :\\n\\nHe looked uncertainly at Lupin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin, â\\x80\\x9cbut that does not mean that there wonâ\\x80\\x99t be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and - and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore might know something thatâ\\x80\\x99d work, though,â\\x80\\x9d Ron said. â\\x80\\x9cWhere is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he canâ\\x80\\x99t leave him in this state -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRon - Dumbledores dead,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did nor, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Billâ\\x80\\x99s bed, his hands over his face. Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ronâ\\x80\\x99s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did he die?â\\x80\\x9d whispered Tonks. â\\x80\\x9cHow did it happen?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnape killed him,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cI was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because thatâ\\x80\\x99s where the Mark was. . . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak - and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nHermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Lunaâ\\x80\\x99s mouth trembled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c- more Death Eaters arrived - and then Snape - and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.â\\x80\\x9d Harry couldnâ\\x80\\x99t go on.\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered, â\\x80\\x9cShh! Listen!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nGulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.\\n\\nHow long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMolly and Arthur are on their way,â\\x80\\x9d she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads. â\\x80\\x9cHarry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he - when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some -â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSnape killed Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nShe stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnape,â\\x80\\x9d repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. â\\x80\\x9cWe all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snapeâ\\x80¦ I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe it. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. â\\x80\\x9cWe always knew that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Dumbledore swore he was on our side!â\\x80\\x9d whispered Tonks. â\\x80\\x9cI always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didnâ\\x80\\x99t. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartanedged handkerchief. â\\x80\\x9cI mean . . . with Snapes history â\\x80¦ of course people were bound to wonder. . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s repentance was absolutely genuineâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear a word against him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. â\\x80\\x9cSnape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t realized what he was doing, he was really sorry heâ\\x80\\x99d done it, sorry that they were dead.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey all stared at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Dumbledore believed that?â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin incredulously. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd he didnâ\\x80\\x99t think my mother was worth a damn either,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cbecause she was Mugglebornâ\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x98Mudblood,â\\x80\\x99 he called her. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is all my fault,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. â\\x80\\x9cMy fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he knew they were coming.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t your fault, Minerva,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin firmly. â\\x80\\x9cWe all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his wayâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eatersâ\\x80\\x99 side?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know exactly how it happened,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall distractedly. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us â\\x80¦ and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still donâ\\x80\\x99t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. â\\x80\\x9cSo they got in through the Room of Requirement.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlmost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI messed up, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron bleakly. â\\x80\\x9cWe did like you told us: We checked the Marauderâ\\x80\\x99s Map and we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on itâ\\x80¦ but Malfoy got past us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cHe was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis Hand of Glory,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron. â\\x80\\x9cGives light only to the holder, remember?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyway,â\\x80\\x9d Ginny went on, â\\x80\\x9che must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitchblack -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron bitterly. â\\x80\\x9cFred and Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny. â\\x80\\x9cNothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didnâ\\x80\\x99t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time weâ\\x80\\x99d reached a corridor that was light, theyâ\\x80\\x99d gone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLuckily,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin hoarsely, â\\x80\\x9cRon, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadnâ\\x80\\x99t expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo set off the Mark?â\\x80\\x9d asked Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, turning to Hermione, â\\x80\\x9cwere you - ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOutside Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s office, yes,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, â\\x80\\x9cwith Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the mapâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x93It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d Harry urged her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was so stupid, Harry!â\\x80\\x9d said Hermione in a highpitched whisper. â\\x80\\x9cHe said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -â\\x80\\x9d She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. â\\x80\\x9cWe went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, itâ\\x80\\x99s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize, Harry, we didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize, we just let Snape go!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not your fault,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin firmly. â\\x80\\x9cHermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo then he came upstairs,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mindâ\\x80\\x99s eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, â\\x80\\x9cand he found the place where you were all fighting. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe were in trouble, we were losing,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks in a low voice. â\\x80\\x9cGibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greybackâ\\x80¦ It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone of us could break through,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, â\\x80\\x9cand that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then Snape was there,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, â\\x80\\x9cand then he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,â\\x80\\x9d said Ginny.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cI tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe must have known a spell we didnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d whispered McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cAfter all - he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. â\\x80¦ I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters whoâ\\x80\\x99d escaped up to the tower. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry savagely, â\\x80\\x9cbut to help them, not to stop them . . . and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier - so what happened when he came back down?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cWe all ran forward - those of us who were still standing anyway - and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust - obviously, none of us attacked them -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe just let them pass,â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks in a hollow voice. â\\x80\\x9cWe thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters - and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again - I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe shouted, â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s over,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99d done what heâ\\x80\\x99d meant to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey all fell silent. Fawkesâ\\x80\\x99s lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mind. . . . Had they taken Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.\\n\\nThe doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMolly - Arthur -â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. â\\x80\\x9cI am so sorry -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBill,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Billâ\\x80\\x99s mangled face. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Bill!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou said Greyback attacked him?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. â\\x80\\x9cBut he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t yet know,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere will probably be some contamination, Arthur,â\\x80\\x9d .said Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cIt is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We donâ\\x80\\x99t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley took the nastysmelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Billâ\\x80\\x99s wounds.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Dumbledore â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley. â\\x80\\x9cMinerva, is it true â\\x80¦ Is he really. . . ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore gone,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Billâ\\x80\\x99s mutilated face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter how he looks. . . . Itâ\\x80\\x99s not rreally important. . . but he was a very handsome little bboy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was ggoing to be married!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what do you mean by zat?â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur suddenly and loudly. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, â\\x80\\x98 he was going to be married?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Weasley raised her tearstained face, looking startled. â\\x80\\x9cWell -only that-â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Fleur. â\\x80\\x9cYou theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not what I -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause â\\x80\\x98e will!â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. â\\x80\\x9cIt would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley, â\\x80\\x9cbut I thought perhaps - given how - how he -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or perâ\\x80\\x99aps, you hoped?â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do I care how he looks? I am goodlooking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!â\\x80\\x9d she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.\\n\\nMrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Billâ\\x80\\x99s wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur GreatAuntie Muriel,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, â\\x80\\x9chas a very beautiful tiara - goblinmade - which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Fleur stiffly. â\\x80\\x9cI am sure zat will be lovely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both , women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see!â\\x80\\x9d said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. â\\x80\\x9cShe still wants to marry him, even though heâ\\x80\\x99s been bitten! She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s different,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. â\\x80\\x9cBill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t care either, I donâ\\x80\\x99t care!â\\x80\\x9d said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupinâ\\x80\\x99s robes and shaking them. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve told you a million times. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd the meaning of Tonksâ\\x80\\x99s Patronus and her mousecolored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sinus that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x99ve told you a million times,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, â\\x80\\x9cthat I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve said all along youâ\\x80\\x99re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Weasley over Fleurâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder as she patted her on the back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not being ridiculous,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin steadily. â\\x80\\x9cTonks deserves somebody young and whole.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she wants you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. â\\x80\\x9cAnd after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis isâ\\x80¦ not the moment to discuss it,â\\x80\\x9d said Lupin, avoiding everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes as he looked around distractedly. â\\x80\\x9cDumbledore is dead. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.\\n\\nThe little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve . . . Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done it, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d he choked. â\\x80\\x9cMmoved him. Professor Sproutâ\\x80\\x99s got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwickâ\\x80\\x99s lyin down, but he says heâ\\x80\\x99ll be all righâ\\x80\\x99 in a jiffy, anâ\\x80\\x99 Professor Slughorn says the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s bin informed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Hagrid,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Billâ\\x80\\x99s bed. â\\x80\\x9cI shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses - Slughorn can represent Slytherin - that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry. â\\x80\\x9cBefore I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll come with me. â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry stood up, murmured â\\x80\\x9cSee you in a bitâ\\x80\\x9d to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagallâ\\x80\\x99s office, but for Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress, . . . Apparently she was now headmistress â\\x80¦ so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.\\n\\nIn silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables, Gryffindorâ\\x80\\x99s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Fawkesâ\\x80\\x99s perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his halfmoon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.\\n\\nAfter glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded theâ\\x80\\x99 desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cI would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you that, Professor,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. He had expected the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHarry, it might be important,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cvery, but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t want me to tell anyone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall glared at him. â\\x80\\x9cPotterâ\\x80\\x9d - Harry registered the renewed use of his surname - â\\x80\\x9cin the light of Professor Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, shrugging. â\\x80\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.â\\x80\\x9d But -\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmertaâ\\x80\\x99s under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, thatâ\\x80\\x99s how the necklace and the poisoned mead -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRosmerta?â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSnape!â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. â\\x80\\x9cSnape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallowfaced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas. â\\x80\\x9cMinerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Everard,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly to her teachers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,â\\x80\\x9d she said quickly. â\\x80\\x9cPersonally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwartsâ\\x80\\x99s history. It is horrible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Sprout. â\\x80\\x9cI feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut will we have a single pupil after this?â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. â\\x80\\x9cParents will want to keep their children at home and I canâ\\x80\\x99t say I blame them. Personally, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think weâ\\x80\\x99re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you canâ\\x80\\x99t expect mothers to think like that. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll want to keep their families together, itâ\\x80\\x99s only natural.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI agree,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cAnd in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school - and I must say that Professor Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherinâ\\x80\\x99s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must consult the governors,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s office. â\\x80\\x9cWe must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHagrid, you havenâ\\x80\\x99t said anything,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, â\\x80\\x9cI dunno, Professor . . . thatâ\\x80\\x99s fer the Heads of House an the headmistress ter decide â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore always valued your views,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall kindly, â\\x80\\x9cand so do I.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m stayin,â\\x80\\x9d said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s me home, itâ\\x80\\x99s bin me home since I was thirteen. Anâ\\x80\\x99 if thereâ\\x80\\x99s kids who wanâ\\x80\\x99 me ter teach â\\x80\\x98em, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it. Butâ\\x80¦ I dunno â\\x80¦ Hogwarts without Dumbledore .. .â\\x80\\x9d He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, â\\x80\\x9cthen I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s funeral?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, speaking at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell. . .â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. â\\x80\\x9cI - I know that it was Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen thatâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99ll happen, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry fiercely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf the Ministry thinks it appropriate,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cNo other headmaster or headmistress has ever been -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,â\\x80\\x9d growled Hagrid.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHogwarts should be Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s final resting place,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Flitwick.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor Sprout.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd in that case,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, â\\x80\\x9cyou shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t send the students home until the jfuneralâ\\x80\\x99s over. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll want to say -â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nThe last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him. â\\x80\\x9cGoodbye.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell said,â\\x80\\x9d squeaked Professor Flitwick. â\\x80\\x9cWell said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterward.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeconded,â\\x80\\x9d barked Professor Sprout. ]\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose â\\x80¦ yes .. .â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s coming,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. â\\x80\\x9cThe Minister . . . and by the looks of it. heâ\\x80\\x99s brought a delegation . . .â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan I leave, Professor?â\\x80\\x9d said Harry at once.\\n\\nHe had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may,â\\x80\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. â\\x80\\x9cAnd quickly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; hehad left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it true?â\\x80\\x9d whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. â\\x80\\x9cIt is really true? Dumbledore - dead?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nShe let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.\\n\\nAs Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jampacked. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boysâ\\x80\\x99 dormitories.\\n\\nAs he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own fourposter and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re talking about closing the school,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLupin said they would,â\\x80\\x9d said Ron.\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. â\\x80\\x9cDid you find one? Did you get it? A - a Horcrux?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t get it?â\\x80\\x9d said Ron, looking crestfallen. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry. â\\x80\\x9cSomeone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlready taken - ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. â\\x80¦ It did not matter tonight. . . nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s life. . . .\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cR.A.B.,â\\x80\\x9d whispered Ron, â\\x80\\x9cbut who was that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDunno,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing. And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that ilie phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 30: The White Tomb\\n\\n\\nAll lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days - the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughtylooking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused pointblank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Durnbledore.\\n\\nSome excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powderblue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome oliveskinned, blackhaired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he\\n\\nwas sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s last excursion from Hogwarts.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Durnbledore had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginnyâ\\x80\\x99s examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted â\\x80¦ and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.\\n\\nThey visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfreyâ\\x80\\x99s care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to MadEye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed jusi the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80¦ so eet ees lucky â\\x80\\x98e is marrying me,â\\x80\\x99 said Fleur happily, plumping up Billâ\\x80\\x99s pillows, â\\x80\\x98because ze British overcook their meat, I â\\x80\\x98ave always said this.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I suppose Iâ\\x80\\x99m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,â\\x80\\x99 sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sheâ\\x80\\x99s not that bad,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Ugly, though,â\\x80\\x99 he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, 1 can.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Anyone else we know died?â\\x80\\x99 Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.\\n\\nHermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 she said reprovingly, folding up ihe newspaper. â\\x80\\x98Theyâ\\x80\\x99re still looking for Snape, but no sign â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Of course there isnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, who became angry every lime this subject cropped up. They wonâ\\x80\\x99t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as theyâ\\x80\\x99ve never managed to do that in all this time â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to go to bed,â\\x80\\x99 yawned Ginny. â\\x80\\x98I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been sleeping thai well since â\\x80¦ well â\\x80¦ I could do with some sleep.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved al the other two and departed for the girlsâ\\x80\\x99 dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forwards towards Harry with a most Hermioneish look on her face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry, I found something ou( this morning, in the library ..,â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98R.A.B.?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, silling up straight.\\n\\nHe did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: â\\x80\\x98the locket .., the cup â\\x80¦ the snake â\\x80¦ something of Gryffindorâ\\x80\\x99s or Ravenclawâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦ the locket â\\x80¦ the cup â\\x80¦ the snake â\\x80¦ something of Gryffindorâ\\x80\\x99s or Ravenclawâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis mantra seemed to pulse through Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mind as he\\n\\nfell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb â\\x80¦\\n\\nHe had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s death, and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 she said sadly, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been trying, Harry, but I havenâ\\x80\\x99t found anything â\\x80¦ there are a couple of reasonably wellknown wizards with those initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs â\\x80¦ Rupert â\\x80\\x9cAxebangerâ\\x80\\x9d Brookstanton â\\x80¦ but they donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him â\\x80¦ no, actually, itâ\\x80\\x99s about â\\x80¦ well, Snape.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe looked nervous even saying the name again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What about him?â\\x80\\x99 asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, itâ\\x80\\x99s just that I was sort of right about the HalfBlood Prince business,â\\x80\\x99 she said tentatively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dâ\\x80\\x99you have to rub it in, Hermione? How tTyou think 1 feel about that now?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No - no - Harry, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that!â\\x80\\x99 she said hastily, looking around to check that they were not being overheard. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s just that 1 was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see â\\x80¦ she was Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s mother!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nT thought she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t much of a looker,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron. Hermione ignored him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x981 was going through ihe rest of the old Prophets and there\\n\\nwas a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that sheâ\\x80\\x99d given birth to a -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- murderer,â\\x80\\x99 spat Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well â\\x80¦ yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione. â\\x80\\x98So â\\x80¦ 1 was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being â\\x80\\x9chalf a Princeâ\\x80\\x9d, you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggie from what it said in the Prophetâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, that fits,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99d play up the pureblood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them â\\x80¦ heâ\\x80\\x99s just like Voldemort. Pureblood mother, Muggie father â\\x80¦ ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort - the HalfBlood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s inexcusable trust in Snape â\\x80¦ but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same â\\x80¦ in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much â\\x80¦\\n\\nHelped him â\\x80¦ it was an almost unendurable thought, now â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I still donâ\\x80\\x99t get why he didnâ\\x80\\x99t turn you in for using that book,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron. â\\x80\\x98He mustâ\\x80\\x99ve known where you were getting it ali from.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He knew,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry bitterly. â\\x80\\x98He knew when I used Secfumsempra. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t really need Legilimency â\\x80¦ he might even have known before then, with Slughom talking about how brilliant I was at Potions â\\x80¦ shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But why didnâ\\x80\\x99t he turn you in?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t ihink he wanted to associate himself with that book,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if heâ\\x80\\x99d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been his, Slughom would have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s old classroom, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called â\\x80\\x9cPrinceâ\\x80\\x9d.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nT shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve shown the book to Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98All that lime he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and 1 had proof Snape was, too -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9dEvilâ\\x80\\x9d is a strong word,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying to say, Harry, that youâ\\x80\\x99re pulling too much blame on yourself. 1 thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98None of us couldâ\\x80\\x99ve guessed Snape would â\\x80¦ you know,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron.\\n\\nSilence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body would be laid to rest. Harry had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult 10 believe that Dumbledore\\n\\nhad really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back â\\x80¦ he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.\\n\\nHarry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Downstairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s chair was deserted too: Harry thought thai perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast; but Snapeâ\\x80\\x99s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeourâ\\x80\\x99s entourage Harry spotted the red hair and hornrimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.\\n\\nOver at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were mutter\\n\\ning together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked\\n\\noddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between\\n\\nthem, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy\\n\\nmuch thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had\\n\\nnot forgotten the fear in Malfoyâ\\x80\\x99s voice on that Tower top, nor\\n\\nthe fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death\\n\\nEaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have\\n\\nkilled Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatu\\n\\nation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity\\n\\nmingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy\\n\\nnow, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of\\n\\nkilling him and his parents? ? â\\x80¢â\\x80¢â\\x80¢>.\\n\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is nearly time,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Please follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emeraldgreen robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothbails.\\n\\nThey were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summerâ\\x80\\x99s day.\\n\\nAn extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, MadEye Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up twoandahalf chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harryâ\\x80\\x99s Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the\\n\\nwizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hogâ\\x80\\x99s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most â\\x80¦ probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting â\\x80¦\\n\\nCornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her redtakmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her ironcoloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the waterâ\\x80\\x99s edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.\\n\\nThe staff were seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore wasand he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98In there,â\\x80\\x99 whispered Ginny in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\n\\nAnd he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harryâ\\x80\\x99s neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round.\\n\\nHagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body. A sharp pain rose in Harryâ\\x80\\x99s throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s laps.\\n\\nThey could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge â\\x80¦ but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagridâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid\\n\\nwas heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his halfbrother and Grawp palled Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again.\\n\\nA little tuftyhaired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads. â\\x80\\x98Nobility of spiritâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x98intellectual contributionâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80¦ â\\x80\\x98greatness of heartâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80¦ it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s idea of a few words: â\\x80\\x98nitwitâ\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98oddmentâ\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98blubberâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98tweak 1, and again, had to suppress a grin â\\x80¦ what was the matter with him?\\n\\nThere was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the waterâ\\x80\\x99s edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said â\\x80¦\\n\\nAnd then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone â\\x80¦ he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on â\\x80¦ there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them\\n\\nstanding quite still, halfhidden in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated â\\x80¦\\n\\nAnd Harry saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parentâ\\x80\\x99s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before.\\n\\nThe little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.\\n\\nThen several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heartstopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s body and the table on which he had rested.\\n\\nThere were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaursâ\\x80\\x99 tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.\\n\\nHarry looked ai Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ronâ\\x80\\x99s face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harryâ\\x80\\x99s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say â\\x80\\x98Be carefulâ\\x80\\x99, or â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t do itâ\\x80\\x99, but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ginny, listen â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99 he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet. â\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t be involved with you any more. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got to stop seeing each other. We canâ\\x80\\x99t be together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe said, with an oddly twisted smile, â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s for some stupid, noble reason, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s been like â\\x80¦ like something out of someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s life, these last few weeks with you,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98But 1 canâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80¦ we canâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80¦ Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got things to do alone now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe did not cry, she simply looked at him,\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. Heâ\\x80\\x99s already used you as bait once, and that was just because youâ\\x80\\x99re my best friendâ\\x80\\x99s sister. Think how much danger youâ\\x80\\x99ll be in if we keep this up. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll know, heâ\\x80\\x99ll find out. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll try and get to me through you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What if I donâ\\x80\\x99t care?â\\x80\\x99 said Ginny fiercely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I care,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98How do you think Iâ\\x80\\x99d feel if this was your funeral â\\x80¦ and it was my fault â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe looked away from him, over the lake.\\n\\nT never really gave up on you,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Not really. I always hoped â\\x80¦ Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Smart girl, that Hermione,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, trying to smile. â\\x80\\x98I just wish Iâ\\x80\\x99d asked you sooner. We coukTve had ages â\\x80¦ months â\\x80¦ years maybe â\\x80¦â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But youâ\\x80\\x99ve been too busy saving the wizarding world,â\\x80\\x99 said Ginny, halflaughing. â\\x80\\x98Well â\\x80¦ I canâ\\x80\\x99t say Iâ\\x80\\x99m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I like you so much.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it â\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been hoping to have a word â\\x80¦ do you mind if I walk a little way with you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry indifferently, and set off again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,â\\x80\\x99 said Scrimgeour quietly, â\\x80\\x98I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows better than 1 -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80¢What do you want?â\\x80\\x99 asked Harry flatly.\\n\\nScrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are, of course, devastated,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What do you want?â\\x80\\x99 Harry repeated, coming to a halt.\\n\\nScrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whose word?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Glad to hear it,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Well, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t want people to know.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Such loyalty is admirable, of course,â\\x80\\x99 said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, â\\x80\\x98bul Dumbledore is gone, Harry. Heâ\\x80\\x99s gone.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My dear boy â\\x80¦ even Dumbledore cannot return from the-â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am not saying he can. You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t understand. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got nothing to tell you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nScrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently\\n\\nsupposed to be a tone of delicacy, The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors wonâ\\x80\\x99t stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So,â\\x80\\x99 said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, â\\x80\\x98the request 1 made of you at Christmas -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What request? Oh yeah â\\x80¦ the one where I tell the world what a great job youâ\\x80\\x99re doing in exchange for â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98- for raising everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s morale!â\\x80\\x99 snapped Scrimgeour.\\n\\nHarry considered him for a moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Released Stan Shunpike yet?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nScrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x981 see you are -â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s man through and through,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s right.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nScrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying towards Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction; Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did Scrimgeour want?â\\x80\\x99 Hermione whispered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Same as he wanted at Christmas,â\\x80\\x99 shrugged Harry. â\\x80\\x98Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministryâ\\x80\\x99s new poster boy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nRon seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, â\\x80\\x98Look, let me go back and hit Percy!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 she said firmly, grabbing his arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99ll make me feel better!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I canâ\\x80\\x99t bear the idea that we might never come back.â\\x80\\x99 she said softly. â\\x80\\x98How can Hogwarts close?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Maybe it wonâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron. â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99re not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhereâ\\x80\\x99s the same now. Iâ\\x80\\x99d even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What dâ\\x80\\x99you reckon, Harry?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m not coming back even if it does reopen,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry.\\n\\nRon gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, â\\x80\\x98I knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do? 1\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going back to the Dursleysâ\\x80\\x99 once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,â\\x80\\x99 said Harry. â\\x80\\x98But itâ\\x80\\x99ll be a short visit, and then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be gone for good.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But where will you go if you donâ\\x80\\x99t come back to school?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I thought I might go back to Godricâ\\x80\\x99s Hollow,â\\x80\\x99 Harry muttered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s death. â\\x80\\x98For me, it started there, all of it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parentsâ\\x80\\x99 graves, Iâ\\x80\\x99d like that.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And then what?â\\x80\\x99 said Ron.\\n\\nThen Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, havenâ\\x80\\x99t I?â\\x80\\x99 said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what he wanted me to do, thatâ\\x80\\x99s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right - and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure he was -there are still four of them out there. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to find them and destroy them and then Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s soul, the bit thatâ\\x80\\x99s still in his body, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m the one whoâ\\x80\\x99s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape\\n\\nalong the way,â\\x80\\x99 he added, â\\x80\\x99so much trie better tor me, so mucn the worse for him.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ll be there, Harry,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt your aunt and uncleâ\\x80\\x99s house,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron. â\\x80\\x98And then weâ\\x80\\x99ll go with you, wherever youâ\\x80\\x99re going.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No -â\\x80\\x99 said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You said to us once before,â\\x80\\x99 said Hermione quietly, â\\x80\\x98that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve had time, havenâ\\x80\\x99t we?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99re with you whatever happens,â\\x80\\x99 said Ron. â\\x80\\x98But, mate, youâ\\x80\\x99re going to have to come round my mum and dadâ\\x80\\x99s house before we do anything else, even Godricâ\\x80\\x99s Hollow.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bill and Fleurâ\\x80\\x99s wedding, remember?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHarry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yeah, we shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t miss that,â\\x80\\x99 he said finally.\\n\\nHis hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione. \""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(corpus)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Qo6Oj0QeW4Zw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733894004795,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1741,"user":{"displayName":"Kiranmai Palangthod chathurakshari","userId":"16836085104748418154"}},"outputId":"bb48f681-b8e0-481b-9add-bd4be3af43a4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the governmentâs fault.\n","\n","The Prime Ministerâs pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and wellpublicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?\n","\n","âA grim mood has gripped the country,â the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.\n","\n","And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of Julyâ¦ It wasnât right, it wasnât normalâ¦\n","\n","He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.\n","\n","He froze, nose to nose with his own scaredlooking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room.\n","\n","âHello?â he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.\n","\n","For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming â as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough â from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.\n","\n","âTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.â\n","\n","The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.\n","\n","âEr,â said the Prime Minister, âlistenâ¦ Itâs not a very good time for meâ¦ Iâm waiting for a telephone call, you seeâ¦ from the President ofââ\n","\n","âThat can be rearranged,â said the portrait at once. The Prime Ministerâs heart sank. He had been afraid of that.\n","\n","âBut I really was rather hoping to speakââ\n","\n","âWe shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,â said the little man. âKindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.â\n","\n","âIâ¦ ohâ¦ very well,â said the Prime Minister weakly. âYes, Iâll see Fudge.â\n","\n","He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pinstriped cloak, a limegreen bowler hat in his hand.\n","\n","âAhâ¦ Prime Minister,â said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. âGood to see you again.â\n","\n","The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.\n","\n","âHow can I help you?â he said, shaking Fudgeâs hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.\n","\n","âDifficult to know where to begin,â muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. âWhat a week, what a weekâ¦â\n","\n","âHad a bad one too, have you?â asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.\n","\n","âYes, of course,â said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. âIâve been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridgeâ¦ the Bones and Vance murdersâ¦ not to mention the ruckus in the West Countryâ¦â\n","\n","âYouâerâyourâI mean to say, some of your people wereâwere involved in thoseâthose things, were they?â\n","\n","Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. âOf course they were,â he said, âSurely youâve realized whatâs going on?â\n","\n","âIâ¦â hesitated the Prime Minister.\n","\n","It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudgeâs visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.\n","\n","He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself\n","\n","Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfproclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudgeâs kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the stilldumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.\n","\n","âNot to worry,â he had said, âitâs oddson youâll never see me again. Iâll only bother you if thereâs something really serious going on our end, something thatâs likely to affect the Mugglesâthe nonmagical population, I should say. Otherwise, itâs live and let live. And I must say, youâre taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.â\n","\n","At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. âYouâreâyouâre not a hoax, then?â\n","\n","It had been his last, desperate hope.\n","\n","âNo,â said Fudge gently. âNo, Iâm afraid Iâm not. Look.â\n","\n","And he had turned the Prime Ministerâs teacup into a gerbil.\n","\n","âBut,â said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, âbut whyâwhy has nobody told meâ?â\n","\n","âThe Minister of Magic only reveals himâor herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,â said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. âWe find it the best way to maintain secrecy.â\n","\n","âBut then,â bleated the Prime Minister, âwhy hasnât a former Prime Minister warned meâ?â\n","\n","At this, Fudge had actually laughed.\n","\n","âMy dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?â\n","\n","Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?\n","\n","The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudgeâs arrival. To the Prime Ministerâs dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to pry it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.\n","\n","Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named âSeriousâ Black, something that sounded like âHogwarts,â and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.\n","\n","ââ¦Iâve just come from Azkaban,â Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. âMiddle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flightâ¦ the dementors are in uproarââhe shudderedââtheyâve never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Blackâs a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin YouKnowWhoâ¦ But of course, you donât even know who YouKnowWho is!â He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, âWell, sit down, sit down, Iâd better fill you inâ¦ Have a whiskeyâ¦â\n","\n","The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Ministerâs hand, and drew up a chair.\n","\n","Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Ministerâs whiskeyfree hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.\n","\n","âSo you think thatâ¦â He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. âLord Volââ\n","\n","âHeWhoMustNotBeNamed!â snarled Fudge.\n","\n","âIâm sorryâ¦ You think that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is still alive, then?â\n","\n","âWell, Dumbledore says he is,â said Fudge, as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin, âbut weâve never found him. If you ask me, heâs not dangerous unless heâs got support, so itâs Black we ought to be worrying about. Youâll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we donât see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.â\n","\n","But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassedlooking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been âinvolved,â but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that YouKnowWhoâs Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.\n","\n","âOh, and I almost forgot,â Fudge had added. âWeâre importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that itâs down in the rule book that we have to notify you if weâre bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.â\n","\n","âIâwhatâdragons?â spluttered the Prime Minister.\n","\n","âYes, three,â said Fudge. âAnd a sphinx. Well, good day to you.â\n","\n","The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.\n","\n","âA mass breakout?â repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.\n","\n","âNo need to worry, no need to worry!â shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames. âWeâll have them rounded up in no timeâjust thought you ought to know!â\n","\n","And before the Prime Minister could shout, âNow, wait just one moment!â Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.\n","\n","Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudgeâs assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The site, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.\n","\n","âHow should I know whatâs going on in theâerâWizarding community?â snapped the Prime Minister now. âI have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment withoutââ\n","\n","âWe have the same concerns,â Fudge interrupted. âThe Brockdale Bridge didnât wear out. That wasnât really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorleyâs family would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungoâs Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be affected tonight.â\n","\n","âWhat do youâ¦ Iâm afraid Iâ¦ What?â blustered the Prime Minister.\n","\n","Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, âPrime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that heâs back. HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is back.â\n","\n","âBack? When you say âbackââ¦ heâs alive? I meanââ\n","\n","The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.\n","\n","âYes, alive,â said Fudge. âThat isâI donât knowâis a man alive if he canât be killed? I donât really understand it, and Dumbledore wonât explain properlyâbut anyway, heâs certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, heâs alive.â\n","\n","The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear wellinformed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.\n","\n","âIs Serious Black withâerâHeWhoMustNotBeNamed?â\n","\n","âBlack? Black?â said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. âSirius Black, you mean? Merlinâs beard, no. Blackâs dead. Turns out we wereâerâmistaken about Black. He was innocent after all. And he wasnât in league with HeWhoMustNotBeNamed either. I mean,â he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, âall the evidence pointedâwe had more than fifty eyewitnessesâbut anyway, as I say, heâs dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. Thereâs going to be an inquiry, actuallyâ¦â\n","\n","To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his chargeâ¦ Not yet, anywayâ¦\n","\n","While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, âBut Blacks bytheby now. The point is, weâre at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.â\n","\n","âAt war?â repeated the Prime Minister nervously. âSurely thatâs a little bit of an overstatement?â\n","\n","âHeWhoMustNotBeNamed has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,â said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a limegreen blur. âSince they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridgeâhe did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him andââ\n","\n","âGood grief, so itâs your fault those people were killed and Iâm having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I donât know what else!â said the Prime Minister furiously.\n","\n","âMy fault!â said Fudge, coloring up. âAre you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?â\n","\n","âMaybe not,â said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, âbut I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!â\n","\n","âDo you really think I wasnât already making every effort?â demanded Fudge heatedly. âEvery Auror in the Ministry wasâand isâtrying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!â\n","\n","âSo I suppose youâre going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?â said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the governmentâs fault after all.\n","\n","âThat was no hurricane,â said Fudge miserably.\n","\n","âExcuse me!â barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. âTrees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuriesââ\n","\n","âIt was the Death Eaters,â said Fudge. âHeWhoMustNotBeNamedâs followers. Andâ¦ and we suspect giant involvement.â\n","\n","The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. âWhat involvement?â\n","\n","Fudge grimaced. âHe used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect,â he said. âThe Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, weâve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, weâve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we canât find the giantâitâs been a disaster.â\n","\n","âYou donât say!â said the Prime Minister furiously.\n","\n","âI wonât deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,â said Fudge. âWhat with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.â\n","\n","âLosing who?â\n","\n","âAmelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think HeWhoMustNotBeNamed may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch andâand all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.â\n","\n","Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.\n","\n","âBut that murder was in the newspapers,â said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. âOur newspapers. Amelia Bonesâ¦ it just said she was a middleaged woman who lived alone. It was aâa nasty killing, wasnât it? Itâs had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see.â\n","\n","Fudge sighed. âWell, of course they are,â he said. âKilled in a room that was locked from the inside, wasnât she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didnât hear about that oneââ\n","\n","âOh yes I did!â said the Prime Minister. âIt happened just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, âbreakdown of law and order in the Prime Ministerâs backyardâââ\n","\n","âAnd as if all that wasnât enough,â said Fudge, barely listening to the Prime Minister, âweâve got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and centerâ¦â\n","\n","Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.\n","\n","âI thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,â he said cautiously.\n","\n","âThey did,â said Fudge wearily. âBut not anymore. Theyâve deserted the prison and joined HeWhoMustNotBeNamed. I wonât pretend that wasnât a blow.â\n","\n","âBut,â said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, âdidnât you tell me theyâre the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?â\n","\n","âThatâs right. And theyâre breeding. Thatâs whatâs causing all this mist.â\n","\n","The Prime Minister sank, weakkneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.\n","\n","âNow see here, Fudgeâyouâve got to do something! Itâs your responsibility as Minister of Magic!â\n","\n","âMy dear Prime Minister, you canât honestly think Iâm still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. Iâve never known them so united in my whole term of office!â said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.\n","\n","The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunkenlooking man sitting opposite him.\n","\n","âIâm very sorry,â he said finally. âIf thereâs anything I can do?â\n","\n","âItâs very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought heâd be here by now, but of course, heâs very busy at the moment, with so much going on.â\n","\n","Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Fudgeâs eye, the portrait said, âHeâll be here in a moment, heâs just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âI wish him luck,â said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. âIâve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he wonât budge. If heâd just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still beâ¦ Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.â\n","\n","Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.\n","\n","âTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.â\n","\n","âYes, yes, fine,â said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.\n","\n","Fudge got to his feet and, after a momentâs hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.\n","\n","The Prime Ministerâs first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wirerimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.\n","\n","âHow do you do?â said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.\n","\n","Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.\n","\n","âFudge told you everything?â he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.\n","\n","âErâyes,â said the Prime Minister. âAnd if you donât mind, Iâd rather that door remained unlocked.â\n","\n","âIâd rather not be interrupted,â said Scrimgeour shortly, âor watched,â he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. âRight, well, Iâm a busy man, so letâs get down lo business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.â\n","\n","The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, âI am perfectly happy with the security Iâve already got, thank you veryââ\n","\n","âWell, weâre not,â Scrimgeour cut in. âItâll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer officeââ\n","\n","âIâm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if thatâs what youâre suggesting!â said the Prime Minister hotly. âHeâs highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of themââ\n","\n","âThatâs because heâs a wizard,â said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. âA highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.â\n","\n","âNow, wait a moment!â declared the Prime Minister. âYou canât just put your people into my office, I decide who works for meââ\n","\n","âI thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?â said Scrimgeour coldly.\n","\n","âI amâthatâs to say, I wasââ\n","\n","âThen thereâs no problem, is there?â said Scrimgeour.\n","\n","âIâ¦ well, as long as Shackleboltâs work continues to beâ¦ erâ¦ excellent,â said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.\n","\n","âNow, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,â he continued. âThe one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.â\n","\n","âWhat about him?â asked the Prime Minister.\n","\n","âHe has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,â said Scrimgeour. âItâs addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.â\n","\n","âHeâs only quacking!â said the Prime Minister weakly. âSurely a bit of a restâ¦ Maybe go easy on the drinkâ¦â\n","\n","âA team of Healers from St. Mungoâs Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,â said Scrimgeour. âI think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.â\n","\n","âIâ¦ wellâ¦ Heâll be all right, wonât he?â said the Prime Minister anxiously.\n","\n","Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.\n","\n","âWell, thatâs really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Ministerâor, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.â\n","\n","Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.\n","\n","âBut for heavenâs sakeâyouâre wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort outâwellâanything!â\n","\n","Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, âThe trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.â\n","\n","And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 2: Spinnerâs End\n","\n","\n","Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Ministerâs windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbishstrewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fishandchip wrappings in the tall grass.\n","\n","But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.\n","\n","With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.\n","\n","âWait!â\n","\n","The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.\n","\n","The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.\n","\n","âJust a fox,â said a womanâs voice dismissively from under the hood. âI thought perhaps an AurorâCissy, wait!â\n","\n","But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.\n","\n","âCissyâNarcissaâlisten to meââ\n","\n","The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.\n","\n","âGo back, Bella!â\n","\n","âYou must listen to me!â\n","\n","âIâve listened already. Iâve made my decision. Leave me alone!â\n","\n","The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.\n","\n","âHe lives here?â asked Bella in a voice of contempt. âHere? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set footââ\n","\n","But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.\n","\n","âCissy, waitlâ\n","\n","Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.\n","\n","âCissy, you must not do this, you canât trust himââ\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord trusts him, doesnât he?â\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord isâ¦ I believeâ¦ mistaken,â Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. âIn any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lordâsââ\n","\n","âLet go, Bella!â snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the otherâs face. Bella merely laughed.\n","\n","âCissy, your own sister? You wouldnâtââ\n","\n","âThere is nothing I wouldnât do anymore!â Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sisterâs arm as though burned.\n","\n","âNarcissa!â\n","\n","But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinnerâs End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.\n","\n","She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.\n","\n","Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.\n","\n","âNarcissa!â said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. âWhat a pleasant surprise!\n","\n","âSeverus,â she said in a strained whisper. âMay I speak to you? Itâs urgent.â\n","\n","âBut of course.â\n","\n","He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her stillhooded sister followed without invitation.\n","\n","âSnape,â she said curtly as she passed him.\n","\n","âBellatrix,â he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.\n","\n","They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candlefilled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.\n","\n","Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.\n","\n","âSo, what can I do for you?â Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.\n","\n","âWeâ¦ we are alone, arenât we?â Narcissa asked quietly.\n","\n","âYes, of course. Well, Wormtailâs here, but weâre not counting vermin, are we?â\n","\n","He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.\n","\n","âAs you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,â said Snape lazily.\n","\n","The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.\n","\n","âNarcissa!â he said, in a squeaky voice. âAnd Bellatrix! How charmingââ\n","\n","âWormtail will get us drinks, if youâd like them,â said Snape. âAnd then he will return to his bedroom.â\n","\n","Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.\n","\n","âI am not your servant!â he squeaked, avoiding Snapeâs eye.\n","\n","âReally? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me.â\n","\n","âTo assist, yesâbut not to make you drinks andâand clean your house!â\n","\n","âI had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,â said Snape silkily. âThis can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lordââ\n","\n","âI can speak to him myself if I want to!â\n","\n","âOf course you can,â said Snape, sneering. âBut in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elfmade wine will do.â\n","\n","Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the bookcovered door behind him.\n","\n","Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord,â he said, raising his glass and draining it.\n","\n","The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, âSeverus, Iâm sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who can help meââ\n","\n","Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.\n","\n","âMy apologies,â said Snape. âHe has lately taken to listening at doors, I donât know what he means by itâ¦ You were saying, Narcissa?â\n","\n","She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.\n","\n","âSeverus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, butââ\n","\n","âThen you ought to hold your tongue!â snarled Bellatrix. âParticularly in present company!â\n","\n","ââPresent companyâ?â repeated Snape sardonically. âAnd what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?â\n","\n","âThat I donât trust you, Snape, as you very well know!â\n","\n","Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrixâs glowering face.\n","\n","âNarcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,â said Snape. âWhy is it that you do not trust me?â\n","\n","âA hundred reasons!â she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. âWhere to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that youâve lived in Dumbledoreâs pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcererâs Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?â\n","\n","She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.\n","\n","Snape smiled.\n","\n","âBefore I answer you â oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?â\n","\n","She hesitated.\n","\n","âI know he believes you, butâ¦â\n","\n","âYou think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?â\n","\n","Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, âYou ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lordâs orders that I took up the post?â\n","\n","She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.\n","\n","âYou ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Luciusâ â he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa â âand many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it isâ¦ If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.â\n","\n","âHeâd have me!â said Bellatrix passionately. âI, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!â\n","\n","âYes, indeed, most admirable,â said Snape in a bored voice. âOf i nurse, you werenât a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine ââ\n","\n","âGesture!â she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. âWhile I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comlortably playing Dumbledoreâs pet!â\n","\n","âNot quite,â said Snape calmly. âHe wouldnât give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse ,.. tempt me into my old ways.â\n","\n","âThis was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?â she jeered. âWhy did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?â\n","\n","âHardly,â said Snape, âalthough the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcomeback present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban isâ¦â\n","\n","âBut you stayed ââ\n","\n","âYes, Bellatrix, I stayed,â said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. âI had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Dumbledoreâs protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.\n","\n","âI think you next wanted to know,â he pressed on, ;i little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, âwhy I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcererâs Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledoreâs stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.â\n","\n","Bellatrixâs mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.\n","\n","âBut you didnât return when he came back, you didnât fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn ââ\n","\n","âCorrect. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledoreâs orders.â\n","\n","âOn Dumbledoreâs â ?â she began, in tones of outrage.\n","\n","âThink!â said Snape, impatient again. âThink! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lordâs side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didnât I?\n","\n","âThe Dark Lordâs initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, 1 assure you, when I explained that 1 remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.â\n","\n","âBut what use have you been?â sneered Bellatrix. âWhat useful information have we had from you?â\n","\n","âMy information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,â said Snape. âIf he chooses not to share it with you ââ\n","\n","âHe shares everything with me!â said Bellatrix, firing up at once. âHe calls me his most loyal, his most faithful ââ\n","\n","âDoes he?â said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. âDoes he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?â\n","\n","âThat was not my fault!â said Bellatrix, flushing. âThe Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious â if Lucius hadnât ââ\n","\n","âDonât you dare â donât you dare blame my husband!â said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.\n","\n","âThere is no point apportioning blame,â said Snape smoothly. âWhat is done, is done.â\n","\n","âBut not by you!â said Bellatrix furiously. âNo, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?â\n","\n","âMy orders were to remain behind,â said Snape. âPerhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And â forgive me â you speak of dangersâ¦ you were facing six teenagers, were you not?â\n","\n","âThey were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!â snarled Bellatrix. âAnd, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, donât you?â\n","\n","âI am not the SecretKeeper; I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.â\n","\n","He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did nor soften.\n","\n","âYou are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?â\n","\n","âHave you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?â asked Snape.\n","\n","âHeâ¦ lately, weâ¦ I am asking you, Snape!â\n","\n","âIf I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible ââ\n","\n","âYou claim you foresaw his use of the boy!â she jeered.\n","\n","âI do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year agoâ¦â\n","\n","âBut why did you keep him alive?â\n","\n","âHave you not understood me? It was only Dumbledoreâs protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lordâs attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, 1 admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle.\n","\n","âOf course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and selfsatisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.â\n","\n","âAnd through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?â asked Bellatrix. âHe has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?â\n","\n","âI have played my part well,â said Snape. âAnd you overlook Dumbledoreâs greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms â though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard â oh yes, he has,â (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), âthe Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.â\n","\n","Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.\n","\n","âNowâ¦ you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?â\n","\n","Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.\n","\n","âYes, Severus. I â I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail andâ¦â\n","\n","She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,â Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. âHe wishes none to know of the plan. It isâ¦ very secret. But ââ\n","\n","âIf he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,â said Snape at once. âThe Dark Lordâs word is law.â\n","\n","Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.\n","\n","âThere!â she said triumphantly to her sister. âEven Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!â\n","\n","But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\n","\n","âIt so happens that I know of the plan,â he said in a low voice. âI am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.â\n","\n","âI thought you must know about it!â said Narcissa, breathing more freely. âHe trusts you so, Severusâ¦â\n","\n","âYou know about the plan?â said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. âYou know?â\n","\n","âCertainly,â said Snape. âBut what help do you require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.â\n","\n","âSeverus,â she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. âMy sonâ¦ my only sonâ¦â\n","\n","âDraco should be proud,â said Bellatrix indifferently. âThe Dark I ,ord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: I Ic isnât shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect ââ\n","\n","Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.\n","\n","âThatâs because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance lor Luciusâs mistake, I know it!â\n","\n","Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.\n","\n","âThatâs why heâs chosen Draco, isnât it?â she persisted. âTo punish Lucius?â\n","\n","âIf Draco succeeds,â said Snape, still looking away from her, âhe will be honored above all others.â\n","\n","âBut he wonât succeed!â sobbed Narcissa. âHow can he, when the Dark Lord himselfâ ?â\n","\n","Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.\n","\n","âI only meantâ¦ that nobody has yet succeededâ¦ Severusâ¦ pleaseâ¦ You are, you have always been, Dracoâs favorite teacherâ¦ You are Luciusâs old friendâ¦ I beg youâ¦ You are the Dark Lordâs favorite, his most trusted advisorâ¦ Will you speak to him, persuade him â ?â\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,â said Snape flatly. âI cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.â\n","\n","âThen I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!â choked Narcissa. âHe does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!â\n","\n","When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little selfrestraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, âYou could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us ââ\n","\n","Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, âHe intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.â\n","\n","âIn other words, it doesnât matter to him if Draco is killed!â\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord is very angry,â repeated Snape quietly. âHe failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.â\n","\n","She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the (loor.\n","\n","âMy only sonâ¦ my only sonâ¦â\n","\n","âYou should be proud!â said Bellatrix ruthlessly. âIf I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!â\n","\n","Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, iind steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand.\n","\n","âNarcissa, thatâs enough. Drink this. Listen to me.â\n","\n","She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.\n","\n","âIt might be possibleâ¦ for me to help Draco.â\n","\n","She sat up, her face paperwhite, her eyes huge.\n","\n","âSeverus â oh, Severus â you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?â\n","\n","âI can try.â\n","\n","She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snapeâs feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.\n","\n","âIf you are there to protect himâ¦ Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?â\n","\n","âThe Unbreakable Vow?â\n","\n","Snapeâs expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.\n","\n","âArenât you listening, Narcissa? Oh, heâll try, Iâm sureâ¦ The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of actionâ¦ oh, on the Dark Lordâs orders, of course!â\n","\n","Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissaâs tearfilled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.\n","\n","âCertainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,â he said quietly. âPerhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.â\n","\n","Bellatrixâs mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrixâs astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.\n","\n","âYou will need your wand, Bellatrix,â said Snape coldly.\n","\n","She drew it, still looking astonished.\n","\n","âAnd you will need to move a little closer,â he said.\n","\n","She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.\n","\n","Narcissa spoke.\n","\n","âWill you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts ta fulfill the Dark Lordâs wishes?â\n","\n","âI will,â said Snape.\n","\n","A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a redhot wire.\n","\n","âAnd will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?â\n","\n","âI will,â said Snape.\n","\n","A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.\n","\n","âAnd, should it prove necessaryâ¦ if it seems Draco will failâ¦â whispered Narcissa (Snapeâs hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), âwill you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?â\n","\n","There was a momentâs silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.\n","\n","âI will,â said Snape.\n","\n","Bellatrixâs astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a fiery snake.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 3: Will And Wonât\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.\n","\n","The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledypiggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk.

He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong â his reply to Dumbledoreâs letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.\n","\n","The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window went out.\n","\n","Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.\n","\n","Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Then as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of clasps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, âWho the blazes is calling at this lime of night?â\n","\n","Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky mid close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, âGood evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?â\n","\n","Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of armâs reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waistlength silver hair and beard. Halfmoon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and.1 pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledoreâs, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.\n","\n","âJudging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,â said Dumbledore pleasantly. âHowever, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.â\n","\n","He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.\n","\n","âIt is a long time since my last visit,â said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. âI must say, your agapanthus are flourishing.â\n","\n","Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon â the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point â but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.\n","\n","âAh, good evening Harry,â said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his halfmoon glasses with a most satisfied expression. âExcellent, excellent.â\n","\n","These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say âexcellentâ was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.\n","\n","âI donât mean to be rude ââ he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.\n","\n","ââyet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,â Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. âBest to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.â\n","\n","The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harryâs aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual prebedtime wipedown of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.\n","\n","âAlbus Dumbledore,â said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. âWe have corresponded, of course.â Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. âAnd this must be your son, Dudley?â\n","\n","Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door, his large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and I car. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the â¢.ilcncc stretched on he smiled.\n","\n","âShall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?â\n","\n","Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. I lurry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last lew stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in i he armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.\n","\n","âArenât â- arenât we leaving, sir?â Harry asked anxiously.\n","\n","âYes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to disi us.s first,â said Dumbledore. âAnd I would prefer not to do so in (he open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncleâs hospitality only a little longer.â\n","\n","âYou will, will you?â\n","\n","Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, iind Dudley skulking behind them both.\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore simply, âI shall.â\n","\n","He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.\n","\n","âWe may as well be comfortable,â said Dumbledore pleasantly.\n","\n","As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â¢ <Â¦ââ¢Â¦\n","\n","âSir â what happened to your â ?â\n","\n","âLater, Harry,â said Dumbledore. âPlease sit down.â\n","\n","Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.\n","\n","âI would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,â Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, âbut the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.â\n","\n","A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honeycolored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.\n","\n","âMadam Rosmertas finest oakmatured mead,â said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\n","\n","âWell, Harry,â said Dumbledore, turning toward him, âa difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Siriusâs will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everyihing he owned.â\n","\n","Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernons head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, âOh. Right.â\n","\n","âThis is, in the main, fairly straightforward,â Dumbledore went on. âYou add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at (iringotts, and you inherit all of Siriusâs personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy ââ\n","\n","âHis godfatherâs dead?â said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. 1 )umbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernons head; he attempted to beat it away. âHeâs dead? His godfather?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. âOur problem,â he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, âis that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.â\n","\n","âHeâs been left a house?â said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.\n","\n","âYou can keep using it as headquarters,â said Harry. âI donât care. You can have it, I donât really want it.â Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.\n","\n","âThat is generous,â said Dumbledore. âWe have, however, vacated the building temporarily.â\n","\n","âWhy?â\n","\n","âWell,â said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, âBlack family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of âBlack.â Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.â\n","\n","A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Siriusâs mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harryâs mind. âI bet there has,â he said.\n","\n","âQuite,â said Dumbledore. âAnd if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Siriusâs living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.â\n","\n","Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Siriusâs killer, inherit his house?\n","\n","âNo,â he said.\n","\n","âWell, obviously we would prefer that she didnât get it either,â said Dumbledore calmly. âThe situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Siriusâs hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position,â\n","\n","âBut how are you going to find out if Iâm allowed to own it?â\n","\n","âFortunately,â said Dumbledore, âthere is a simple test.â\n","\n","He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, âWill you get these ruddy things off us?â\n","\n","Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.\n","\n","âOh, Iâm so sorry,â said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. âBut it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.â\n","\n","It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledoreâs wand.\n","\n","âYou see,â Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, âif you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited ââ\n","\n","He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a houseelf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant batâs ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleysâ shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hairraising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, âWhat the hell is that?â\n","\n","âKreacher,â finished Dumbledore.\n","\n","âKreacher wonât, Kreacher wonât, Kreacher wonât!â croaked the houseelf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling lii.s ears. âKreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher wonât go to the Potter brat, Kreacher wonât, wonât, wonât ââ\n","\n","âAs you can see, Harry,â said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacherâs continued croaks of âwont, wonât, wonât,â âKreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.â\n","\n","âI donât care,â said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping houseelf. âI donât want him.â\n","\n","âWonât, wonât, wonât, wonât ââ\n","\n","âYou would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?â\n","\n","âWonât, wonât, wonât, wonât ââ\n","\n","Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.\n","\n","âGive him an order,â said Dumbledore. âIf he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.â\n","\n","âWonât, wonât, wonât, WONâT!â\n","\n","Kreacherâs voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, âKreacher, shut up!â\n","\n","It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.\n","\n","âWell, that simplifies matters,â said Dumbledore cheerfully. âIt means that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.â\n","\n","âDo I â do I have to keep him with me?â Harry asked, aghast, us Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.\n","\n","âNot if you donât want to,â said Dumbledore. âIf I might make ii suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other houseelves could keep an eye on him.â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry in relief, âyeah, Iâll do that. Er â Kreacher â I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other houseelves.â\n","\n","Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upsidedown look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.\n","\n","âGood,â said Dumbledore. âThere is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements ââ\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry at once, âhe can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.â\n","\n","âHagrid will be delighted,â said Dumbledore, smiling. âHe was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeakâs safety, to rechristen him âWitherwingsâ for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?â\n","\n","Ermâ¦\n","\n","âDoubtful that I would turn up?â Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.\n","\n","âIâll just go and â er â finish off,â said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.\n","\n","It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwigâs cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs,\n","\n","He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.\n","\n","Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, âProfessor â Iâm ready now.â\n","\n","âGood,â said Dumbledore. âJust one last thing, then.â And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.\n","\n","âAs you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a years time ââ\n","\n","âNo,â said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledoreâs arrival.\n","\n","âIâm sorry?â said Dumbledore politely.\n","\n","âNo, he doesnât. Heâs a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesnât turn eighteen until the year after next.â\n","\n","âAh,â said Dumbledore pleasantly, âbut in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.â\n","\n","Uncle Vernoii muttered, âPreposterous,â but Dumbledore ignored him,\n","\n","âNow, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort Was returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parentsâ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him ;is though he were your own.â\n","\n","Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.\n","\n","âYou did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.â\n","\n","Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinclively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.\n","\n","âUs â mistreat Dudders? What dâyou â ?â began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his ringer for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.\n","\n","âThe magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house âhome.â However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.â\n","\n","None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.\n","\n","âWell, Harryâ¦ time for us to be off,â said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak. âUntil we meet again,â he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.\n","\n","âBye,â said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harryâs trunk, upon which Hedwigâs cage was perched.\n","\n","âWe do not want to be encumbered by these just now,â he said, pulling out his wand again. âI shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloakâ¦ just in case.â\n","\n","Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.\n","\n","âAnd now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 4: Horace Slughorn\n","\n","\n","Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last facetoface encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harryâs sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledoreâs most prized possessions.\n","\n","Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.\n","\n","âKeep your wand at the ready, Harry,â he said brightly.\n","\n","âBut I thought Iâm not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?â\n","\n","âIf there is an attack,â said Dumbledore, âI give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.â\n","\n","âWhy not, sir?â\n","\n","âYou are with me,â said Dumbledore simply. âThis will do, Harry.â\n","\n","He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.\n","\n","âYou have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,â he said.\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry. âI thought you had to be seventeen?â\n","\n","âYou do,â said Dumbledore. âSo you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you donât mind â as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.â\n","\n","Harry gripped Dumbledoreâs proffered forearm.\n","\n","âVery good,â said Dumbledore. âWell, here we go.â\n","\n","Harry felt Dumbledoreâs arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then â-\n","\n","He gulped great lungfulls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.\n","\n","âAre you all right?â asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. âThe sensation does take some getting used to.â\n","\n","âIâm fine,â said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. âBut I think I might prefer broomsâ¦â\n","\n","Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more lightly around his neck, and said, âThis way.â\n","\n","He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.\n","\n","âSo tell me, Harry,â said Dumbledore. âYour scarâ¦ has it been hurting at all?â\n","\n","Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed i he lightningshaped mark.\n","\n","âNo,â he said, âand Iâve been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemortâs getting so powerful again.â\n","\n","He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.\n","\n","âI, on the other hand, thought otherwise,â said Dumbledore. âLord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you.â\n","\n","âWell, Iâm not complaining,â said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemortâs mind.\n","\n","They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. âProfessor?â\n","\n","âHarry?â\n","\n","âEr â where exactly are we?â\n","\n","âThis, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.â\n","\n","âAnd what are we doing here?â\n","\n","âAh yes, of course, I havenât told you,â said Dumbledore. âWell, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.â\n","\n","âHow can I help with that, sir?â\n","\n","âOh, I think weâll find a use for you,â said Dumbledore vaguely. âLeft here, Harry.â\n","\n","They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.\n","\n","âProfessor, why couldnât we just Apparate directly into your old colleagueâs house?â\n","\n","âBecause it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,â said Dumbledore. âCourtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance ââ\n","\n","ââ you canât Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,â said Harry quickly. âHermione Granger told me.â\n","\n","âAnd she is quite right. We turn left again.â\n","\n","The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.\n","\n","âSir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sackedâ¦â\n","\n","âCorrect,â said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. âHe has been replaced, as ] am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.â\n","\n","âIs heâ¦ Do you think heâs good?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âAn interesting question,â said Dumbledore. âHe is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.â\n","\n","âYes, but I meant ââ\n","\n","âI know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.â\n","\n","Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed ii. âAndâ¦ sirâ¦ I saw about Madam Bones.â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore quietly. âA terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think â ouch.â\n","\n","He had pointed with his injured hand.\n","\n","âProfessor, what happened to your â¦ ?â\n","\n","âI have no time to explain now,â said Dumbledore. âIt is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.â\n","\n","He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.\n","\n","âSir â I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eatersâ¦â\n","\n","âYes, I received one myself,â said Dumbledore, still smiling. âDid you find it useful?â\n","\n","âNot really.â\n","\n","âNo, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.â\n","\n","âI didnâtâ¦â Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.\n","\n","âFor future reference, Harry, it is raspberryâ¦ although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.â\n","\n","âErâ¦ right,â said Harry. âWell, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasnât very clear.â\n","\n","âThey are corpses,â said Dumbledore calmly. âDead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizardâs bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerfulâ¦ He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just hereâ¦â\n","\n","They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.\n","\n","âOh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.â\n","\n","Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.\n","\n","Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.\n","\n","âWand out and follow me, Harry,â he said quietly.\n","\n","He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.\n","\n","âLumos.â\n","\n","Dumbledoreâs wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him.\n","\n","A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier flittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harryâs small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around.\n","\n","âNot pretty, is it?â he said heavily. âYes, something horrible has happened here.â\n","\n","Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around, halfscared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.\n","\n","âMaybe there was a fight and â and they dragged him off, Professor?â Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.\n","\n","âI donât think so,â said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.\n","\n","âYou mean heâs â ?â\n","\n","âStill here somewhere? Yes.â\n","\n","And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, âOuch!â\n","\n","âGood evening, Horace,â said Dumbledore, straightening up again.\n","\n","Harrys jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.\n","\n","âThere was no need to stick the wand in that hard,â he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. âIt hurt.â\n","\n","The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledoreâs chin.\n","\n","âWhat gave it away?â he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.\n","\n","âMy dear Horace,â said Dumbledore, looking amused, âif the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.â\n","\n","The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.\n","\n","âThe Dark Mark,â he muttered. âKnew there was somethingâ¦ ah well. Wouldnât have had time anyway, Iâd only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.â\n","\n","He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.\n","\n","âWould you like my assistance clearing up?â asked Dumbledore politely.\n","\n","âPlease,â said the other.\n","\n","They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.\n","\n","The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments relormed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.\n","\n","âWhat kind of blood was that, incidentally?â asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock.\n","\n","âOn the walls? Dragon,â shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.\n","\n","There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.\n","\n","âYes, dragon,â repeated the wizard conversationally. âMy last bottle, and prices are skyhigh at the moment. Still, it might be reusable.â\n","\n","He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.\n","\n","âHmm. Bit dusty.â\n","\n","He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.\n","\n","âOho,â he said, his large round eyes flying to Harryâs forehead and the lightningshaped scar it bore. âOho!â\n","\n","âThis,â said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, âis Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old Friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.â\n","\n","Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. âSo thatâs how you thought youâd persuade me, is it? Well, the answerâs no, Albus.â\n","\n","He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.\n","\n","âI suppose we can have a drink, at least?â asked Dumbledore. âFor old timeâs sake?â\n","\n","Slughorn hesitated.\n","\n","âAll right then, one drink,â he said ungraciously.\n","\n","Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.\n","\n","âHmpf,â he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. âHere ââ He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.\n","\n","âWell, how have you been keeping, Horace?â Dumbledore asked.\n","\n","âNot so well,â said Slughorn at once. âWeak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Canât move like I used to. Well, thatâs to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.â\n","\n","âAnd yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,â said Dumbledore. âYou canât have had more than three minutesâ warning?â\n","\n","Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, âTwo. Didnât hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still,â he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, âthe fact remains that Iâm an old man, Albus. A tired old man whoâs earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.â\n","\n","He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.\n","\n","âYouâre not yet as old as I am, Horace,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âWell, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,â said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledoreâs injured hand. âReactions not what they were, I see.â\n","\n","âYouâre quite right,â said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harryâs neck prickle unpleasantly. â1 am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other handâ¦â\n","\n","He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughornâs eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.\n","\n","âSo, all these precautions against intruders, Horaceâ¦ are they for the Death Eatersâ benefit, or mine?â asked Dumbledore.\n","\n","âWhat would the Death Eaters want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me?â demanded Slughorn.\n","\n","âI imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder,â said Dumbledore. âAre you really telling me that they havenât come recruiting yet?â\n","\n","Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, âI havenât given them the chance. Iâve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house â the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands â itâs been very pleasant, Iâll be sorry to leave. Itâs quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors donât spot you bringing in the piano.â\n","\n","âIngenious,â said Dumbledore. âBut it sounds a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts ââ\n","\n","âIf youâre going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If thatâs how you treat teachers these days ââ\n","\n","âProfessor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,â said Dumbledore. âI think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs âfilthy halfbreeds.ââ\n","\n","âThatâs what she did, did she?â said Slughorn. âIdiotic woman. Never liked her.â\n","\n","Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.\n","\n","âSorry,â Harry said hastily. âItâs just â I didnât like her either.â\n","\n","Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.\n","\n","âAre you leaving?â asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.\n","\n","âNo, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âOh,â said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. âSecond on the left down the hall.â\n","\n","Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.\n","\n","âDonât think I donât know why heâs brought you,â he said abruptly.\n","\n","Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughornâs watery eyes slid over Harryâs scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.\n","\n","âYou look very like your father.â\n","\n","âYeah, Iâve been told,â said Harry.\n","\n","âExcept for your eyes. Youâve got â-â\n","\n","âMy motherâs eyes, yeah.â Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.\n","\n","âHmpf. Yes, well. You shouldnât have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,â Slughorn added, in answer to Harrys questioning look. âLily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.â\n","\n","âWhich was your House?â\n","\n","âI was Head of Slytherin,â said Slughorn. âOh, now,â he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harryâs face and wagging a stubby ringer at him, âdonât go holding that against me! Youâll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done â been in the papers for the last couple of years â died a few weeks ago ââ\n","\n","It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harryâs intestines and held them tight.\n","\n","âWell, anyway, he was a big pal of your fatherâs at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame â he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but Iâd have liked the set.â\n","\n","He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.\n","\n","âYour mother was Muggleborn, of course. Couldnât believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pureblood, she was so good.â\n","\n","âOne of my best friends is Muggleborn,â said Harry, âand sheâs the best in our year.â\n","\n","âFunny how that sometimes happens, isnât it?â said Slughorn.\n","\n","âNot really,â said Harry coldly.\n","\n","Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. âYou mustnât think Iâm prejudiced!â he said. âNo, no, no! Havenât I just said your mother was one of my alltime favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too â now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course â another Muggleborn, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goingson at Gringotts!â\n","\n","He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a selfsatisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.\n","\n","âAll exstudents, all signed. Youâll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, heâs always interested to hear my take on the dayâs news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes â a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave him his first job! And at the back â youâll see her if you just crane your neck â thatâs Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpiesâ¦ People are always astonished to hear Iâm on firstname terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!â\n","\n","This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.\n","\n","âAnd all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?â asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.\n","\n","The smile slid from Slughornâs face as quickly as the blood from his walls.\n","\n","âOf course not,â he said, looking down at Harry. âI have been out of touch with everybody for a year.â\n","\n","Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.\n","\n","âStillâ¦ the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while Iâm sure theyâre very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I donât personally fancy the mortality rate ââ\n","\n","âYou donât have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,â said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughornâs cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. âMost of the teachers arenât in it, and none of them has ever been killed â well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort.â\n","\n","Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemortâs name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored.\n","\n","âI reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledoreâs headmaster; heâs supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isnât he?â Harry went on.\n","\n","Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harryâs words.\n","\n","âWell, yes, it is true that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,â he muttered grudgingly. âAnd I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters, HeWhoMustNotBeNamed can hardly count me a friendâ¦ in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albusâ¦ I cannot pretend that Amelia Bonesâs death did not shake meâ¦ If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protectionâ¦â\n","\n","Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.\n","\n","âOh, there you are, Albus,â he said. âYouâve been a very long lime. Upset stomach?â\n","\n","âNo, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,â said Dumbledore. âI do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horaceâs hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.â\n","\n","Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn sinned taken aback.\n","\n","âYouâre leaving?â\n","\n","âYes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.â\n","\n","âLostâ¦?â\n","\n","Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.\n","\n","âWell, Iâm sorry you donât want the job, Horace,â said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. âHogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.â\n","\n","âYesâ¦ wellâ¦ very graciousâ¦ as I sayâ¦â\n","\n","âGoodbye, then.â\n","\n","âBye,â said Harry.\n","\n","They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.\n","\n","âAll right, all right, Iâll do it!â\n","\n","Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.\n","\n","âYou will come out of retirement?â\n","\n","âYes, yes,â said Slughorn impatiently. âI must be mad, but yes.â\n","\n","âWonderful,â said Dumbledore, beaming. âThen, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.â\n","\n","âYes, I daresay you will,â grunted Slughorn.\n","\n","As they set off down the garden path, Slughornâs voice floated after them, âIâll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!â\n","\n","Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.\n","\n","âWell done, Harry,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âI didnât do anything,â said Harry in surprise.\n","\n","âOh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?â\n","\n","âErâ¦â\n","\n","Harry wasnât sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggleborn should make a good witch.\n","\n","âHorace,â said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, âlikes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat â more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office.â\n","\n","Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.\n","\n","âI tell you all this,â Dumbledore continued, ânot to turn you against Horace â or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn â but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; âthe Boy Who Livedââ¦ or, as they call you these days, âthe Chosen One.ââ\n","\n","At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survivesâ¦\n","\n","Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.\n","\n","âThis will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.â\n","\n","Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in thereâ¦ and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knewâ¦\n","\n","âIf you donât mind, Harry,â said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, âIâd like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?â\n","\n","Dumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.\n","\n","âI hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.â\n","\n","Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say âHis godfatherâs dead?â and even worse to hear Siriuss name thrown out casually by Slughorn.\n","\n","âIt was cruel,â said Dumbledore softly, âthat you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.â\n","\n","Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledoreâs hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleysâ lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness i hat he had come to associate with dementors.\n","\n","âItâs just hard,â Harry said finally, in a low voice, âto realize he wonât write to me again.â\n","\n","His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering his godfatherâ¦ and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort againâ¦\n","\n","âSirius represented much to you that you had never known before,â said Dumbledore gently. âNaturally, the loss is devastatingâ¦\n","\n","âBut while I was at the Dursleysââ¦â interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, âI realized I cant shut myself away or â or crack up. Sirius wouldnât have wanted that, would he? And anyway, lifeâs too shortâ¦ Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vanceâ¦ It could be me next, couldnât it? But if it is,â he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledoreâs blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, âIâll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.â\n","\n","âSpoken both like your mother and fatherâs son and Siriusâs true godson!â said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harryâs back. âI take my hat off to you â or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders.\n","\n","âAnd now, Harry, on a closely related subjectâ¦ I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.\n","\n","âThen you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry again. âAnd now everyone knows that Iâm the one â\n","\n","âNo, they do not,â interrupted Dumbledore. âThere are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.\n","\n","âNow, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry.\n","\n","âA wise decision, on the whole,â said Dumbledore. âAlthough I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,â he continued, when Harry looked startled, âI think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.â\n","\n","âI didnât want ââ\n","\n","ââ to worry or frighten them?â said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles. âOr perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.â\n","\n","Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. He continued, âOn a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.â\n","\n","âPrivate â with you?â said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.\n","\n","âYes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education.â\n","\n","What will you be teaching me, sir?â\n","\n","âOh, a little of this, a little of that,â said Dumbledore airily.\n","\n","Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so ho asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.\n","\n","âIf Iâm having lessons with you, I wonât have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?â\n","\n","âProfessor Snape, Harry â and no, you will not.â\n","\n","âGood,â said Harry in relief, âbecause they were a ââ\n","\n","He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.\n","\n","âI think the word âfiascoâ would be a good one here,â said Dumbledore, nodding.\n","\n","Harry laughed.\n","\n","âWell, that means I wonât see much of Professor Snape from now on,â he said, âbecause he wonât let me carry on Potions unless I get âOutstandingâ in my OWL., which I know I havenât.â\n","\n","âDonât count your owls before they are delivered,â said Dumbledore gravely. âWhich, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.\n","\n","âFirstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all i imes from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?â\n","\n","Harry nodded.\n","\n","âAnd lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly â all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.â\n","\n","âI understand,â said Harry quickly.\n","\n","âVery well, then,â said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. âI see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 5: An Excess Of Phlegm\n","\n","\n","Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.\n","\n","âWhoâs there?â said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasleyâs. âDeclare yourself!â\n","\n","âIt is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.â\n","\n","The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.\n","\n","âHarry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!â\n","\n","âWe were lucky,â said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the threshold. âSlughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Harryâs doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!â\n","\n","Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.\n","\n","âHello, Professor,â she said. â Wotcher, Harry.â\n","\n","âHi, Tonks.â\n","\n","Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegumpink hair.\n","\n","âIâd better be off,â she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. âThanks for the tea and sympathy, Mollyâ\n","\n","âPlease donât leave on my account,â said Dumbledore courteously, âI cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.â\n","\n","âNo, no, I need to get going,â said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledoreâs eyes. ââNightâ¦â\n","\n","âDear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and MadEye are comingâ¦ ?â\n","\n","âNo, really, Mollyâ¦ thanks anywayâ¦ Good night, everyone.\n","\n","Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.\n","\n","âWell, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,â said Dumbledore. âTake care of yourself. Molly, your servant.â\n","\n","He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.\n","\n","âYouâre like Ron,â she sighed, looking him up and down. âBoth of you look as though youâve had Stretching jinxes put on you. I swear Ronâs grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?â\n","\n","âYeah, I am,â said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was,\n","\n","âSit down, dear, Iâll knock something up.â\n","\n","As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.\n","\n","âSo Hermioneâs here?â he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.\n","\n","âOh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,â said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. âEveryoneâs in bed, of course, we didnât expect you for hours. Here you areâ¦â\n","\n","She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.\n","\n","âBread, dear?â\n","\n","âThanks, Mrs. Weasley.â\n","\n","She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him.\n","\n","âSo you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?â\n","\n","Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.\n","\n","âHe taught Arthur and me,â said Mrs. Weasley. âHe was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?â\n","\n","His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.\n","\n","âI know what you mean,â said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. âOf course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthurâs never liked him much. The Ministryâs littered with Slughornâs old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthurâ¦ didnât seem to think he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I donât know whether Ronâs told you in any of his lettersâ¦ itâs only just happenedâ¦ but Arthurâs been promoted!â\n","\n","It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.\n","\n","Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering. âThatâs great!â he gasped.\n","\n","âYou are sweet,â beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. âYes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthurâs heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. Itâs a big job, heâs got ten people reporting to him now!â\n","\n","âWhat exactly?â\n","\n","âWell, you see, in all the panic about YouKnowWho, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against YouKnowWho and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thingâ¦ socalled protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall offâ¦ Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Hotelier, whoâve never done an honest dayâs work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, itâs a very important job, and I tell him itâs just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.â Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.\n","\n","âIs Mr. Weasley still at work?â Harry asked.\n","\n","âYes, he is. As a matter of fact, heâs a tiny bit lateâ¦ He said heâd be back around midnightâ¦â\n","\n","She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on i he Weasleysâ sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at âmortal peril.â\n","\n","âItâs been like that for a while now,â said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, âever since YouKnowWho came back into the open. I suppose everybodyâs in mortal danger nowâ¦ I donât think it can be just our familyâ¦ but I donât know anyone else whoâs got a clock like this, so I canât check. Oh!â\n","\n","With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clockâs face. Mr. Weasleyâs hand had switched to âtraveling.â\n","\n","âHeâs coming!â\n","\n","And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, âArthur, is that you?â\n","\n","âYes,â came Mr. Weasleyâs weary voice. âBut I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!â\n","\n","âOh, honestlyâ¦â\n","\n","âMolly!â\n","\n","âAll right, all rightâ¦ What is your dearest ambition?â\n","\n","âTo find out how airplanes stay up.â\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.\n","\n","âMolly! Iâve got to ask you your question first!â\n","\n","âArthur, really, this is just sillyâ¦â\n","\n","âWhat do you like me to call you when weâre alone together?â\n","\n","Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.\n","\n","âMollywobbles,â whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.\n","\n","âCorrect,â said Mr. Weasley. âNow you can let me in.â\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, redhaired wizard wearing hornrimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.\n","\n","âI still donât see why we have to go through that every time you come home,â said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. âI mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!â\n","\n","âI know, dear, but itâs Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells goodâ¦ onion soup?â\n","\n","Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.\n","\n","âHarry! We didnât expect you until morning!â\n","\n","They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.\n","\n","âThanks, Molly. Itâs been a tough night. Some idiotâs started selling MetamorphMedals. Just sling them around your neck and youâll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!â\n","\n","âAnd what really happens when you put them on?â\n","\n","âMostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungoâs didnât have enough to do already!â\n","\n","âIt sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,â said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. âAre you sureâ¦ ?â\n","\n","âOf course I am!â said Mr. Weasley. âThe boys wouldnât do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!â\n","\n","âSo is that why youâre late, MetamorphMedals?â\n","\n","âNo, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got thereâ¦â\n","\n","Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.\n","\n","âBed,â said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. âIâve got Fred and Georgeâs room all ready for you, youâll have it to yourself.â\n","\n","âWhy, where are they?â\n","\n","âOh, theyâre in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as theyâre so busy,â said Mrs. Weasley. âI must say, I didnât approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunks already up there.â\n","\n","ââNight, Mr. Weasley,â said Harry, pushing back his chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.\n","\n","âGânight, Harry,â said Mr. Weasley.\n","\n","Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at âmortal peril.â\n","\n","Fred and Georgeâs bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harryâs school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.\n","\n","Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purpleandorange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.\n","\n","Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other.\n","\n","âWuzzgoinon?â\n","\n","âWe didnât know you were here already!â said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.\n","\n","âRon, donât hit him!â said a girlâs voice reproachfully.\n","\n","Harryâs hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though I he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.\n","\n","âAll right?â\n","\n","âNever been better,â said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. âYou?â\n","\n","âNot bad,â said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. âWhen did you get here? Mumâs only just told us!â\n","\n","âAbout one oâclock this morning.â\n","\n","âWere the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?â\n","\n","âSame as usual,â said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed, âthey didnât talk to me much, but I like it better that way. Howâre you, Hermione?â\n","\n","âOh, Iâm fine,â said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Siriusâs death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, âWhatâs the time? Have I missed breakfast?â\n","\n","âDonât worry about that, Mumâs bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,â said Ron, rolling his eyes. âSo, whatâs been going on?â\n","\n","âNothing much, Iâve just been stuck at my aunt and uncleâs, havenât I?â\n","\n","âCome off it!â said Ron. âYouâve been off with Dumbledore!â\n","\n","âIt wasnât that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His nameâs Horace Slughorn.â\n","\n","âOh,â said Ron, looking disappointed. âWe thoughtâ¦â\n","\n","Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\n","\n","ââ¦we thought itâd be something like that.â\n","\n","âYou did?â said Harry, amused.\n","\n","âYeahâ¦ yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, donât we? So, er, whatâs he like?â\n","\n","âHe looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin,â said Harry. âSomething wrong, Hermione?â\n","\n","She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.\n","\n","âNo, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like heâll be a good teacher?â\n","\n","âDunno,â said Harry. âHe canât be worse than Umbridge, can he?â\n","\n","âI know someone whoâs worse than Umbridge,â said a voice from the doorway. Ronâs younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. âHi, Harry.â\n","\n","âWhatâs up with you?â Ron asked.\n","\n","âItâs her,â said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harryâs bed. âSheâs driving me mad.â\n","\n","âWhatâs she done now?â asked Hermione sympathetically.\n","\n","âItâs the way she talks to meâ¦ youâd think I was about three!â\n","\n","âI know,â said Hermione, dropping her voice. âSheâs so full of herself.â\n","\n","Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, âCanât you two lay off her for five seconds?â\n","\n","âOh, thatâs right, defend her,â snapped Ginny. âWe all know you canât get enough of her.â\n","\n","This seemed an odd comment to make about Ronâs mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, âWho are youâ¦ ?â\n","\n","But his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor.\n","\n","A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.\n","\n","ââArry,â she said in a throaty voice. âEet âas been too long!â\n","\n","As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.\n","\n","âThere was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!â\n","\n","âEet was no trouble,â said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harryâs knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. âI âave been longing to see âim. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about âArry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.â\n","\n","âOhâ¦ is she here too?â Harry croaked.\n","\n","âNo, no, silly boy,â said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, âI mean next summer, when weâ¦ but do you not know?â\n","\n","Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, âWe hadnât got around to telling him yet.â\n","\n","Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.\n","\n","âBill and I are going to be married!â\n","\n","âOh,â said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one anotherâs gaze. âWow. Erâ¦ congratulations!â\n","\n","She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.\n","\n","âBill is very busy at ze moment, working very âard, and I only work parttime at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me âere for a few days to get to know âis family properly. I was so pleased to âear you would be comingâ¦ zere isnât much to do âere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Wellâ¦ enjoy your breakfast, âArry!â\n","\n","With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like, âtchah!â\n","\n","âMum hates her,â said Ginny quietly.\n","\n","âI do not hate her!â said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. âI just think theyâve hurried into this engagement, thatâs all!â\n","\n","âTheyâve known each other a year,â said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door.\n","\n","âWell, thatâs not very long! I know why itâs happened, of course. Its all this uncertainty with YouKnowWho coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so theyâre rushing all sorts of decisions theyâd normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and centerâ¦â\n","\n","âIncluding you and Dad,â said Ginny slyly.\n","\n","âYes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?â said Mrs. Weasley. âWhereas Bill and Fleurâ¦ wellâ¦ what have they really got in common? Heâs a hardworking, downtoearth sort of person, whereas sheâsâ¦â\n","\n","âA cow,â said Ginny, nodding. âBut Billâs not that downtoearth. Heâs a CurseBreaker, isnât he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamourâ¦ I expect thatâs why heâs gone for Phlegm.â\n","\n","âStop calling her that, Ginny,â said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. âWell, Iâd better get onâ¦ Eat your eggs while theyâre warm, Harry.â\n","\n","Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punchdrunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.\n","\n","âDonât you get used to her if sheâs staying in the same house?â Harry asked.\n","\n","âWell, you do,â said Ron, âbut if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like thenâ¦â\n","\n","âItâs pathetic,â said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.\n","\n","âYou donât really want her around forever?â Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, âWell, Mumâs going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.â\n","\n","âHowâs she going to manage that?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âShe keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think sheâs hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, Iâd much rather have her in the family.â\n","\n","âYeah, thatâll work,â said Ron sarcastically. âListen, no bloke in his right mindâs going to fancy Tonks when Fleurâs around. I mean, Tonks is okaylooking when she isnât doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, butâ¦â\n","\n","âSheâs a damn sight nicer than Phlegm? said Ginny.\n","\n","âAnd sheâs more intelligent, sheâs an Auror!â said Hermione from the corner.\n","\n","âFleurâs not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,â said Harry.\n","\n","âNot you as well!â said Hermione bitterly.\n","\n","âI suppose you like the way Phlegm says â âAny,â do you?â asked Ginny scornfully.\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry, wishing he hadnât spoken, âI was just saying, Phlegmâ¦ I mean, Fleurâ¦â\n","\n","âIâd much rather have Tonks in the family,â said Ginny. âAt least sheâs a laugh.â\n","\n","âShe hasnât been much of a laugh lately,â said Ron. âEvery time Iâve seen her sheâs looked more like Moaning Myrtle.â\n","\n","âThatâs not fair,â snapped Hermione. âShe still hasnât got over what happenedâ¦ you knowâ¦ I mean, he was her cousin!â\n","\n","Harryâs heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.\n","\n","âTonks and Sirius barely knew each other!â said Ron. âSirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never metâ¦â\n","\n","âThatâs not the point,â said Hermione. âShe thinks it was her limit he died!â\n","\n","âHow does she work that one out?â asked Harry, in spite of himself.\n","\n","âWell, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasnât she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldnât have killed Sirius.â\n","\n","âThatâs stupid,â said Ron.\n","\n","âItâs survivorâs guilt,â said Hermione. âI know Lupinâs tried to talk her round, but sheâs still really down. Sheâs actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!â\n","\n","âWith herâ¦?â\n","\n","âShe canât change her appearance like she used to,â explained Hermione. âI think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.â\n","\n","âI didnât know that could happen,â said Harry.\n","\n","âNor did I,â said Hermione, âbut I suppose if youâre really depressedâ¦â\n","\n","The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. âGinny,â she whispered, âcome downstairs and help me with the lunch.â\n","\n","âIâm talking to this lot!â said Ginny, outraged.\n","\n","âNow!â said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.\n","\n","âShe only wants me there so she doesnât have to be alone with Phlegm!â said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.\n","\n","âYou lot had better come down quickly too,â she said as she left.\n","\n","Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and Georgeâs boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping himself to Harryâ¦s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.\n","\n","âWhatâs this?â Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.\n","\n","âDunno,â said Ron, âbut if Fred and George left it here, itâs probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be carefulâ\n","\n","âYour mum said the shopâs going well,â said Harry. âSaid Fred and George have got a real flair for business.â\n","\n","âThatâs an understatement,â said Ron. âTheyâre raking in the Galleons! I canât wait to see the place, we havenât been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dadâs got to be there for extra security and heâs been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.â\n","\n","âAnd what about Percy?â asked Harry; the thirdeldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. âIs he talking to your mum and dad again?â\n","\n","âNope,â said Ron.\n","\n","âBut he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being backâ¦â\n","\n","âDumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,â said Hermione. âI heard him telling your mum, Ron.â\n","\n","âSounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,â said Ron.\n","\n","âHeâs going to be giving me private lessons this year,â said Harry conversationally.\n","\n","Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.\n","\n","âYou kept that quiet!â said Ron.\n","\n","âI only just remembered,â said Harry honestly. âHe told me last night in your broom shed.â\n","\n","âBlimeyâ¦ private lessons with Dumbledore!â said Ron, looking impressed. âI wonder why heâsâ¦ ?â\n","\n","His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to do itâ¦ Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, âI donât know exactly why heâs going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.â\n","\n","Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, âYou know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.â\n","\n","âNobody knows what it said, though,â said Hermione quickly. âIt got smashed.â\n","\n","âAlthough the Prophet saysâ¦â began Ron, but Hermione said, âShh!â\n","\n","âThe Prophetâs got it right,â said Harry, looking up at them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed. âThat glass ball that smashed wasnât the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledoreâs office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said,â Harry took a deep breath, âit looks like Iâm the one whoâs got to finish off Voldemortâ¦ At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives.â\n","\n","The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.\n","\n","âHermione!â shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.\n","\n","Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.\n","\n","âI squeezed it and itâ¦ it punched me!â she gasped.\n","\n","And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\n","\n","âDonât worry,â said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, âMumâll fix that, sheâs good at healing minor injuriesâ¦â\n","\n","âOh well, never mind that now!â said Hermione hastily. âHarry, oh, Harryâ¦â\n","\n","She sat down on the edge of his bed again.\n","\n","âWe wondered, after we got back from the Ministryâ¦ Obviously, we didnât want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like thisâ¦ Oh, Harryâ¦â She stared at him, then whispered, âAre you scared?â\n","\n","âNot as much as I was,â said Harry. âWhen I first heard it, I wasâ¦ but now, it seems as though I always knew Iâd have to face him in the endâ¦â\n","\n","âWhen we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,â said Ron eagerly. âAnd we were kind of right, werenât we? He wouldnât be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldnât waste his timeâ¦ he must think youâve got a chance!â\n","\n","âThatâs true,â said Hermione. âI wonder what heâll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probablyâ¦ powerful countercursesâ¦ antijinxesâ¦â\n","\n","Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.\n","\n","ââ¦and evasive enchantments generally,â concluded Hermione. âWell, at least you know one lesson youâll be having this year, thatâs one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our OWL results will come?â\n","\n","âCant be long now, itâs been a month,â said Ron.\n","\n","âHang on,â said Harry, as another part of last nightâs conversation came back to him. âI think Dumbledore said our OWL results would be arriving today!â\n","\n","âToday?â shrieked Hermione. âToday? But why didnât youâ¦ oh my Godâ¦ you should have saidâ¦â\n","\n","She leapt to her feet.\n","\n","âIâm going to see whether any owls have comeâ¦â\n","\n","But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.\n","\n","âIt just wonât budge,â Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healerâs Helpmate open at âBruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.â âThis has always worked before, I just canât understand it.â\n","\n","âItâll be Fred and Georgeâs idea of a funny joke, making sure it canât come off,â said Ginny.\n","\n","âBut itâs got to come off!â squeaked Hermione. âI canât go around looking like this forever!â\n","\n","âYou wonât, dear, weâll find an antidote, donât worry,â said Mrs. Weasley soothingly.\n","\n","âBill told me W Fred and George are very amusing!â said Fleur, smiling serenely.\n","\n","âYes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,â snapped Hermione.\n","\n","She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.\n","\n","âMrs. Weasley, youâre quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?â\n","\n","âYes, dear, Iâd have noticed,â said Mrs. Weasley patiently. âBut itâs barely nine, thereâs still plenty of timeâ¦â\n","\n","âI know I messed up Ancient Runes,â muttered Hermione feverishly, âI definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking backâ¦â\n","\n","âHermione, will you shut up, youâre not the only one whoâs nervous!â barked Ron. âAnd when youâve got your eleven âOutstanding OWLsâ¦ââ\n","\n","âDonât, donât, donât!â said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. âI know Iâve failed everything!â\n","\n","âWhat happens if we fail?â Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who answered.\n","\n","âWe discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.â\n","\n","Harryâs stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.\n","\n","âAt Beauxbatons,â said Fleur complacently, âwe âad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and thenâ¦â\n","\n","Fleurâs words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.\n","\n","âTheyâre definitely owls,â said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.\n","\n","âAnd there are three of them,â said Harry, hastening to her other side.\n","\n","âOne for each of us,â said Hermione in a terrified whisper. âOh noâ¦ oh noâ¦ oh noâ¦â\n","\n","She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.\n","\n","The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.\n","\n","âOh no!â squealed Hermione.\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.\n","\n","Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Hermioneâs hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.\n","\n","Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.\n","\n","Ordinary Wizarding Level Results\n","\n","Pass Grades:\n","\n","Outstanding (O)\n","\n","Exceeds Expectations (E)\n","\n","Acceptable (A)\n","\n","Fail Grades:\n","\n","Poor (P)\n","\n","Dreadful (D)\n","\n","Troll (T)\n","\n","Harry James Potter has achieved:\n","\n","Astronomy A\n","\n","Care of Magical Creatures E\n","\n","Charms E\n","\n","Defense Against the Dark Arts O\n","\n","Divination P\n","\n","Herbology E\n","\n","History of Magic D\n","\n","Potions E\n","\n","Transfiguration E\n","\n","Harry read the parchment through several times, his breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination, but he had passed everything else! He ran his finger down the gradesâ¦ he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And best of all, he had achieved âOutstandingâ at Defense Against the Dark Arts!\n","\n","He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.\n","\n","âOnly failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?â he said happily to Harry. âHereâ¦ swapâ¦â\n","\n","Harry glanced down Ronâs grades: There were no âOutstandingsâ thereâ¦\n","\n","âKnew youâd be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,â said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. âWeâve done all right, havenât we?â\n","\n","âWell done!â said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ronâs hair. âSeven OWLs, thatâs more than Fred and George got together!â\n","\n","âHermione?â said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadnât turned around. âHow did you do?â\n","\n","âIânot bad,â said Hermione in a small voice.\n","\n","âOh, come off it,â said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. âYepâ¦ ten âOutstandingsâ and one âExceeds Expectationsâ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.â He looked down at her, halfamused, halfexasperated. âYouâre actually disappointed, arenât you?â\n","\n","Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.\n","\n","âWell, weâre N.E.W.T. students now!â grinned Ron. âMum, are there any more sausages?â\n","\n","Harry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regretâ¦ This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldnât, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.\n","\n","It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldnât really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks agoâ¦ Neither can live while the other survivesâ¦Wouldnât he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 6: Dracoâs Detour\n","\n","\n","Harry remained within the confines of the Burrowâs garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days playing twoaside Quidditch in the Weasleysâ orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\n","\n","It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stones of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasleyâs displeasure, Harryâs sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.\n","\n","âThere have been another couple of dementor attacks,â he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. âAnd theyâve found Igor Karkaroffâs body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over itâ¦ well, frankly, Iâm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Siriusâs brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.â\n","\n","âYes, well,â said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, âperhaps we should talk about something diffâ¦â\n","\n","âDid you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?â asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. âThe man who ranâ¦â\n","\n","âIs the icecream place in Diagon Alley?â Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. âHe used to give me free ice creams. Whatâs happened to him?â\n","\n","âDragged off, by the look of his place.â\n","\n","âWhy?â asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.\n","\n","âWho knows? He mustâve upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean.â\n","\n","âTalking of Diagon Alley,â said Mr. Weasley, âlooks like Ollivanderâs gone too.â\n","\n","âThe wandmaker?â said Ginny, looking startled.\n","\n","âThatâs the one. Shopâs empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.â\n","\n","âBut whatâll people do for wands?â\n","\n","âTheyâll make do with other makers,â said Lupin. âBut Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him itâs not so good for us.â\n","\n","The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harryâs included a surprise: he had been made Quidditch Captain.\n","\n","âThat gives you equal status with prefects!â cried Hermione happily. âYou can use our special bathroom now and everything!â\n","\n","âWow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,â said Ron, examining the badge with glee. âHarry, this is so cool, youâre my Captainâ¦ if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha haâ¦â\n","\n","âWell, I donât suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now youâve got these,â sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ronâ¦s booklist. âWeâll go on Saturday as long as your father doesnât have to go into work again. Iâm not going there without him.â\n","\n","âMum, dâyou honestly think YouKnowWhoâs going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?â sniggered Ron.\n","\n","âFortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?â said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. âIf you think securityâs a laughing matter you can stay behind and Iâll get your things myselfâ¦â\n","\n","âNo, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and Georgeâs shop!â said Ron hastily.\n","\n","âThen you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide youâre too immature to come with us!â said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at âmortal peril,â and balancing it on top of a pile of justlaundered towels. âAnd that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!â\n","\n","Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.\n","\n","âBlimeyâ¦ you canât even make a joke round here anymoreâ¦â\n","\n","But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginnyâs pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry.\n","\n","âWhereâs mine?â demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.\n","\n","âThatâs already Harryâs, idiot,â said Bill. âI got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because itâs taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up hisâ¦ Well, trust me, this wayâs easier.â\n","\n","âThanks, Bill,â said Harry, pocketing his gold.\n","\n","âE is always so thoughtful,â purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Billâs nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.\n","\n","It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.\n","\n","âItâs good Dad can get us these again,â said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.\n","\n","âDonât get used to it, itâs only because of Harry,â said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a twoseater sofa. âHeâs been given topgrade security status. And weâll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.â\n","\n","Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.\n","\n","âHere you are, then,â said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. âIâm to wait for you, any idea how long youâll be?â\n","\n","âA couple of hours, I expect,â said Mr. Weasley. âAh, good, heâs here!â\n","\n","Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, blackbearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harryâs face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.\n","\n","âHarry!â he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bonecrushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. âBuckbeakâ¦ Witherwings, I meanâ¦ yeh should see him, Harry, heâs so happy ter be back in the open airâ¦â\n","\n","âGlad heâs pleased,â said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. âWe didnât know âsecurityâ meant you!â\n","\n","âI know, jusâ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch oâ Aurors, but Dumbledore said Iâd do,â said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. âLets get goinâ thenâ¦ after yeh, Molly, Arthurâ¦â\n","\n","The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harryâs memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, âJusâ passinâ through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.â\n","\n","Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.\n","\n","Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blownup versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving blackandwhite photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescueâs Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabbylooking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:\n","\n","AMULETS\n","\n","Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi!\n","\n","A seedylooking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.\n","\n","âOne for your little girl, madam?â he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. âProtect her pretty neck?â\n","\n","âIf I were on dutyâ¦â said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.\n","\n","âYes, but donât go arresting anyone now, dear, weâre in a hurry,â said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. âI think weâd better do Madam Malkinâs first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ronâs showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Harry, youâve grown so muchâ¦ come on, everyoneâ¦â\n","\n","âMolly, it doesnât make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkinâs,â said Mr. Weasley. âWhy donât those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyoneâs schoolbooks?â\n","\n","âI donât know,â said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. âHagrid, do you thinkâ¦- ?â\n","\n","âDonât fret, theyâll be fine with me, Molly,â said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkinâs.\n","\n","Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.\n","\n","âMighâ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,â said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkinâs and bending down to peer through the window. âIâll stand guard outside, all right?â\n","\n","So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.\n","\n","ââ¦ not a child, in case you havenât noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.â\n","\n","There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, âNow, dear, your motherâs quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, itâs nothing to do with being a childâ¦â\n","\n","âWatch where youâre sticking that pin, will you!â\n","\n","A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and whiteblond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.\n","\n","âIf youâre wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,â said Draco Malfoy.\n","\n","âI donât think thereâs any need for language like that!â said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. âAnd I donât want wands drawn in my shop either!â she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, âNo, donât, honestly, itâs not worth it. â\n","\n","âYeah, like youâd dare do magic out of school,â sneered Malfoy. âWho blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.â\n","\n","âThatâs quite enough!â said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. âMadam, please!â\n","\n","Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.\n","\n","âPut those away,â she said coldly to Harry and Ron. âIf you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.â\n","\n","âReally?â said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sisterâs. He was as tall as she was now. âGoing to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?â\n","\n","Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.\n","\n","âReally, you shouldnât accuseâ¦ dangerous thing to sayâ¦ wands away, please!â\n","\n","But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly.\n","\n","âI see that being Dumbledoreâs favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore wonât always be there to protect you.â\n","\n","Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. âWowâ¦ look at thatâ¦ heâs not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!â\n","\n","Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.\n","\n","âDonât you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!â Malfoy snarled.\n","\n","âItâs all right, Draco,â said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. âI expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.â\n","\n","Harry raised his wand higher.\n","\n","âHarry, no!â moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. âThinkâ¦ You mustnâtâ¦ Youâll be in such troubleâ¦â\n","\n","Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldnât. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.\n","\n","âI think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me justâ¦â\n","\n","âOuch!â bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. âWatch where youâre putting your pins, woman! Mother, I donât think I want these anymore.â\n","\n","He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkinâs feet.\n","\n","âYouâre right, Draco,â said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, ânow I know the kind of scum that shops hereâ¦ Weâll do better at Twilfitt and Tattingâs.â\n","\n","And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.\n","\n","âWell, really? said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.\n","\n","She was distracted all through the fitting of Ronâs and Harryâs new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizardâs dress robes instead of witchâs, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.\n","\n","âGot evârything?â asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.\n","\n","âJust about,â said Harry. âDid you see the Malfoys?â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Hagrid, unconcerned. âBu they wouldnâ¦ dare make trouble in the middle oâ Diagon Alley, Harry. Donâ worry abou1 them.â\n","\n","Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of books.\n","\n","âEveryone all right?â said Mrs. Weasley. âGot your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and Georgeâsâ¦ stick close, nowâ¦â\n","\n","Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleysâ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George.\n","\n","âWe really havenât got too long,â Mrs. Weasley said. âSo weâll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, thatâs number ninetytwoâ¦ ninetyfourâ¦â\n","\n","âWhoa,âsaid Ron, stopping in his tracks.\n","\n","Set against the dull, postermuffled shop Fronts around them, Fred and Georges windows hit the eye like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunnedlooking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The lefthand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harrys eyes began to water just looking at it. The righthand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:\n","\n","WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOUKNOWWHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT UNOPOOâ THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THATâS GRIPPING THE NATION!\n","\n","Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name âUNoPoo.â\n","\n","âTheyâll be murdered in their beds!â she whispered.\n","\n","âNo they wonât!â said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. âThis is brilliant!â\n","\n","And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in SelfInking, SpellChecking, and SmartAnswer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted tenyearolds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: Reusable hangman - spell it or heâll swing!\n","\n","âPatented Daydream Charmsâ\n","\n","Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.\n","\n","âOne simple incantation and you will enter a topquality, highly realistic, thirtyminute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to undersixteens. You know,â said Hermione, looking up at Harry, âthat really is extraordinary magic!â\n","\n","âFor that, Hermione,â said a voice behind them, âyou can have one for free.â\n","\n","A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.\n","\n","âHow are you, Harry?â They shook hands. âAnd whatâs happened to your eye, Hermione?â\n","\n","Your punching telescope,â she said ruefully.\n","\n","âOh blimey, I forgot about those,â said Fred. âHereâ¦â\n","\n","He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste.\n","\n","âJust dab it on, that bruiseâll be gone within the hour,â said Fred. âWe had to find a decent bruise remover. Weâre testing most of our products on ourselves.â\n","\n","Hermione looked nervous. âIt is safe, isnât it?â she asked.\n","\n","âCourse it is,â said Fred bracingly. âCome on, Harry, Iâll give you a tour.â\n","\n","Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.\n","\n","âMuggle magic tricks!â said Fred happily, pointing them out. âFor freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. Itâs not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, theyâre great noveltiesâ¦ Oh, hereâs Georgeâ¦â\n","\n","Fredâs twin shook Harrys hand energetically.\n","\n","âGiving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, thatâs where weâre making the real moneyâ¦pocket anything, you, and youâll pay in more than Galleons!â he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled:\n","\n","EDIBLE DARK MARKSâ-THEYâLL MAKE ANYONE SICK!\n","\n","George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued.\n","\n","âWeâve just developed this more serious line,â said Fred. âFunny how it happenedâ¦â\n","\n","âYou wouldnât believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, canât do a decent Shield Charm,â said George. ââCourse, they didnât have you teaching them, Harry.â\n","\n","âThatâs rightâ¦ Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And weâre still getting massive orders!â\n","\n","âSo weâve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Glovesâ¦â\n","\n","ââ¦ I mean, they wouldnât help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxesâ¦â\n","\n","âAnd then we thought weâd get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because itâs such a money spinner,â continued George enthusiastically. âThis is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, weâre importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape.â\n","\n","âAnd our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,â said Fred, pointing at a number of weirdlooking black horntype objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. âYou just drop one surreptitiously and itâll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.\n","\n","âHandy,â said Harry, impressed.\n","\n","âHere,â said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry.\n","\n","A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.\n","\n","âThereâs a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,â she said.\n","\n","Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called âMr. Weasley,â but they took it in their stride.\n","\n","âRight you are, Verity, Iâm coming,â said George promptly. âHarry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge.â\n","\n","âI canât do that!â said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.\n","\n","âYou donât pay here,â said Fred firmly, waving away Harryâs gold.\n","\n","âButâ¦â\n","\n","âYou gave us our startup loan, we havenât forgotten,â said George sternly âTake whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.â\n","\n","George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.\n","\n","âHavenât you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?â asked Fred. âFollow me, ladiesâ¦â\n","\n","Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.\n","\n","âThere you go,â said Fred proudly. âBest range of love potions youâll find anywhere.â\n","\n","Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. âDo they work?â she asked.\n","\n","âCertainly they work, for up to twentyfour hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in questionâ¦â\n","\n","ââ¦ and the attractiveness of the girl,â said George, reappearing suddenly at their side. âBut weâre not selling them to our sister,â he added, becoming suddenly stern, ânot when sheâs already got about five boys on the go from what weâveâ¦â\n","\n","âWhatever youâve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,â said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. âWhatâs this?â\n","\n","âGuaranteed tensecond pimple vanisher,â said Fred. âExcellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but donât change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?â\n","\n","âYes, I am,â said Ginny. âAnd last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?â\n","\n","She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting highpitched squeaks.\n","\n","âPygmy Puffs,â said George. âMiniature puffskeins, we canâ¦t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?â\n","\n","âI dumped him, he was a bad loser,â said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. âTheyâre really cute!â\n","\n","âTheyâre fairly cuddly, yes,â conceded Fred. âBut youâre moving through boyfriends a bit fast, arenât you?â\n","\n","Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasleyish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didnât recoil.\n","\n","âItâs none of your business. And Iâll thank youâ she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at Georgeâs elbow, laden with merchandise, ânot to tell tales about me to these two!â\n","\n","âThatâs three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,â said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ronâs arms. âCough up.â\n","\n","âIâm your brother!â\n","\n","âAnd thatâs our stuff youâre nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. Iâll knock off the Knut.â\n","\n","âBut I havenât got three Galleons, nine Sickles!â\n","\n","âYouâd better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.â\n","\n","Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.\n","\n","âIf I see you do that again Iâll jinx your fingers together,â she said sharply.\n","\n","âMum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?â said Ginny at once.\n","\n","âA what?â said Mrs. Weasley warily.\n","\n","âLook, theyâre so sweetâ¦â\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleysâ Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.\n","\n","âWonder where his mummy is?â said Harry, frowning.\n","\n","âGiven her the slip by the looks of it,â said Ron.\n","\n","âWhy, though?â said Hermione.\n","\n","Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.\n","\n","Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.\n","\n","He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street.\n","\n","âGet under here, quick,â said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.\n","\n","âOh, I donât know, Harry,â said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.\n","\n","âCome on,â said Ron.\n","\n","She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and Georgeâs products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had.\n","\n","âHe was going in that direction,â murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear themâ¦Cmonâ¦\n","\n","They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead.\n","\n","âThatâs him, isnât it?â she whispered. âTurning left?â\n","\n","âBig surprise,â whispered Ron.\n","\n","For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.\n","\n","âQuick, or weâll lose him,â said Harry, speeding up.\n","\n","âOur feetâll be seen!â said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.\n","\n","âIt doesnât matter,â said Harry impatiently. âJust hurry!â\n","\n","But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifactsâ¦ or at least, to be seen buying them.\n","\n","Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.\n","\n","âOuch!â\n","\n","âShh! Look! Heâs in there!â she breathed in Harryâs ear.\n","\n","They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of Malfoyâs hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oilyhaired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.\n","\n","âIf only we could hear what theyâre saying!â said Hermione.\n","\n","âWe can!â said Ron excitedly. âHang on, damn.â\n","\n","He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.\n","\n","âExtendable Ears, look!â\n","\n","âFantastic!â said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. âOh, I hope the door isnât Imperturbableâ¦â\n","\n","âNo!â said Ron gleefully. âListen!â\n","\n","They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Malfoyâs voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.\n","\n","ââ¦ you know how to fix it?â\n","\n","âPossibly,â said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. âIâll need to see it, though. Why donât you bring it into the shop?â\n","\n","âI canât,â said Malfoy. âItâs got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.â\n","\n","Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.\n","\n","âWell, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldnât guarantee anything.â\n","\n","âNo?â said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. âPerhaps this will make you more confident.â\n","\n","He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.\n","\n","âTell anyone,â said Maifoy, âand there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? Heâs a family friend. Heâll be dropping in from time to time to make sure youâre giving the problem your full attention.â\n","\n","âThere will be no need forâ¦â\n","\n","âIâll decide that,â said Malfoy. âWell, Iâd better be off. And donât forget to keep that one safe, Iâll need it.â\n","\n","âPerhaps youâd like to take it now?â\n","\n","âNo, of course I wouldnât, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just donât sell it.â\n","\n","âOf course notâ¦ sir.â\n","\n","Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy.\n","\n","âNot a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?â\n","\n","âNaturally, naturally,â murmured Borgin, bowing again.\n","\n","Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.\n","\n","âWhat was that about?â whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.\n","\n","âDunno,â said Harry, thinking hard. âHe wants something mendedâ¦ and he wants to reserve something in thereâ¦ Could you see what he pointed at when he said âthat oneâ?â\n","\n","âNo, he was behind that cabinetâ¦â\n","\n","âYou two stay here,â whispered Hermione.\n","\n","âWhat are youâ¦ ?â\n","\n","But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry.\n","\n","âHello, horrible morning, isnât it?â Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.\n","\n","âIs this necklace for sale?â she asked, pausing beside a glassfronted case.\n","\n","âIf youâve got one and a half thousand Galleons,â said Mr. Borgin coldly.\n","\n","âOhâ¦ erâ¦ no, I havenât got quite that much,â said Hermione, walking on. âAndâ¦ what about this lovelyâ¦ umâ¦ skull?â\n","\n","âSixteen Galleons.â\n","\n","âSo itâs for sale, then? It isnât beingâ¦ kept for anyone?â\n","\n","Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds.\n","\n","âThe thing is, thatâ¦ erâ¦ boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, heâs a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if heâs already reserved anything, I obviously donât want to get him the same thing, soâ¦ umâ¦â\n","\n","It was a pretty lame story in Harryâs opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.\n","\n","âOut,â he said sharply. âGet out!â\n","\n","Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.\n","\n","âAh well,â said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione. âWorth a try, but you were a bit obviousâ¦â\n","\n","âWell, next time you can show me how itâs done, Master of Mystery!â she snapped.\n","\n","Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleysâ\n","\n","Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxiouslooking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasleys accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 7: The Slug Club\n","\n","\n","Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoyâs behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoyâs face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoyâs activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.\n","\n","âYes, Iâve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,â said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and Georgeâs room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. âBut havenât we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?â\n","\n","âMaybe heâs broken his Hand of Gloryâ said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstickâs bent tail twigs. âRemember that shriveledup arm Malfoy had?â\n","\n","âBut what about when he said, âDonât forget to keep that one safeâ?â asked Harry for the umpteenth time. âThat sounded to me like Borginâs got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.â\n","\n","âYou reckon?â said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.\n","\n","âYeah, I do,â said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, âMalfoyâs fatherâs in Azkaban. Donât you think Malfoyâd like revenge?â\n","\n","Ron looked up, blinking.\n","\n","âMalfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?â\n","\n","âThatâs my point, I donât know!â said Harry, frustrated. âBut heâs up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His fatherâs a Death Eater and â¦â\n","\n","Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.\n","\n","âHarry?â said Hermione in an anxious voice. âWhatâs wrong?â\n","\n","âYour scarâs not hurting again, is it?â asked Ron nervously.\n","\n","âHeâs a Death Eater,â said Harry slowly. âHeâs replaced his father as a Death Eater!â\n","\n","There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. âMalfoy? Heâs sixteen, Harry! You think YouKnowWho would let Malfoy join?â\n","\n","âIt seems very unlikely, Harry,â said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. âWhat makes you think â¦ ?â\n","\n","âIn Madam Malkinâs. She didnât touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. Heâs been branded with the Dark Mark.â\n","\n","Ron and Hermione looked at each other.\n","\n","âWellâ¦â said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.\n","\n","âI think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,â said Hermione.\n","\n","âHe showed Borgin something we couldnât see,â Harry pressed on stubbornly. âSomething that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know itâ¦ he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!â\n","\n","Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.\n","\n","âIâm not sure, Harryâ¦â\n","\n","âYeah, I still donât reckon YouKnowWho would let Malfoy joinâ¦â\n","\n","Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.\n","\n","âI wouldnât go in the kitchen just now,â she warned him. âThereâs a lot of Phlegm around.â\n","\n","âIâll be careful not to slip in it.â Harry smiled.\n","\n","Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of selfpeeling sprouts, looking badtempered.\n","\n","ââ¦ Bill and I âave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold, pink would of course be âorrible with Ginnyâs âair!â\n","\n","âAh, Harry!â said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleurâs monologue. âGood, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. Weâve got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station.â\n","\n","âIs Tonks going to be there?â asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.\n","\n","âNo, I donât think so, sheâs been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.â\n","\n","âShe has let âerself go, zat Tonks,â Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. âA big mistake if you ask.â\n","\n","âYes, thank you,â said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. âYouâd better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we donât have the usual lastminute scramble.â\n","\n","And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermioneâs cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ronâs owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginnyâs new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.\n","\n","âAu revoir, âAny,â said Fleur throatily, kissing him goodbye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleurâs feet. Furious, redfaced, and dirtspattered, he hurried into the car without saying goodbye.\n","\n","There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at Kingâs Cross Station. Instead, two grimfaced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.\n","\n","âQuick, quick, through the barrier,â said Mrs. Weasley, who\n","\n","seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. âHarry had better go first, withâ¦â\n","\n","She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harryâs upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.\n","\n","âI can walk, thanks,â said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Aurorâs grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and threequarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.\n","\n","Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grimfaced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.\n","\n","âWe canât, Harry,â said Hermione, looking apologetic. âRon and Iâve got to go to the prefectsâ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.â\n","\n","âOh yeah, I forgot,â said Harry.\n","\n","âYouâd better get straight on the train, all of you, youâve only got a few minutes to go,â said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. âWell, have a lovely term, Ronâ¦â\n","\n","âMr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?â said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.\n","\n","âOf course,â said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.\n","\n","Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly,\n","\n","because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.\n","\n","He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grimfaced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.\n","\n","âWhen we were in Diagon Alley,â Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.\n","\n","âAm I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and Georgeâs shop?â\n","\n","âHow did youâ¦?â\n","\n","âHarry, please. Youâre talking to the man who raised Fred and George.â\n","\n","âErâ¦ yeah, all right, we werenât in the back room.â âVery well, then, letâs hear the worst.â\n","\n","âWell, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.â\n","\n","âDid you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?â\n","\n","âBecause I thought Malfoy was up to something,â said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasleyâs look of mingled exasperation and amusement. âHeâd given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.â\n","\n","âOf course you did,â said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. âWell? Did you find out why?â\n","\n","âHe went into Borgin and Burkes,â said Harry, âand started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. Andâ¦â\n","\n","Harry took a deep breath.\n","\n","âThereâs something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think heâs been branded with the Dark Mark. 1 think heâs replaced his father as a Death Eater.â\n","\n","Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, âHarry, I doubt whether YouKnowWho would allow a sixteenyearoldâ¦â\n","\n","âDoes anyone really know what YouKnowWho would or wouldnât do?â asked Harry angrily. âMr. Weasley, Iâm sorry, but isnât it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, itâs probably something Dark or dangerous, isnât it?â\n","\n","âI doubt it, to be honest, Harry,â said Mr. Weasley slowly. âYou see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.â âI think you missed something,â said Harry stubbornly. âWell, maybe,â said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.\n","\n","There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.\n","\n","âYouâd better hurry!â said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, âHarry, quickly!â\n","\n","He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train.\n","\n","âNow, dear, youâre coming to us for Christmas, itâs all fixed with Dumbledore, so weâll see you quite soon,â said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. âYou make sure you look after yourself andâ¦â\n","\n","The train was gathering speed.\n","\n","ââ¦be good andâ¦â , She was jogging to keep up now.\n","\n","ââ¦stay safe!â\n","\n","Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefectsâ carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.\n","\n","People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the âChosen Oneâ rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\n","\n","âFancy trying to find a compartment?â\n","\n","âI canât, Harry, I said Iâd meet Dean,â said Ginny brightly. âSee you later.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\n","\n","âHi, Harry!â said a familiar voice from behind him.\n","\n","âNeville!â said Harry in relief, turning to see a roundfaced boy struggling toward him.\n","\n","âHello, Harry,â said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\n","\n","âLuna, hi, how are you?â\n","\n","âVery well, thank you,â said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\n","\n","âQuibbler still going strong, then?â asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.\n","\n","âOh yes, circulationâs well up,â said Luna happily.\n","\n","âLetâs find seats,â said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\n","\n","âTheyâre even staring at us? said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. âBecause weâre with you!â\n","\n","âTheyâre staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,â said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. âOur little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you mustâve\n","\n","seen it.â\n","\n","âYes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,â said Neville, âbut she was really pleased. Says Iâm starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!â\n","\n","He pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\n","\n","âCherry and unicorn hair,â he said proudly. âWe think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day â¦ oi, come back here, Trevor!â\n","\n","And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\n","\n","âAre we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?â asked Luna,\n","\n","who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\n","\n","âNo point now weâve got rid of Umbridge, is there?â said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\n","\n","âI liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!â\n","\n","âI enjoyed the meetings too,â said Luna serenely. âIt was like having friends.â\n","\n","This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourthyear girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.\n","\n","âYou ask him!â\n","\n","No, you!\n","\n","âIâll do it!â\n","\n","And one of them, a boldlooking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.\n","\n","âHi, Harry, Iâm Romilda, Romilda Vane,â she said loudly and confidently. âWhy donât you join us in our compartment? You donât have to sit with them,â she added in a stage whisper, indicating Nevilleâs bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.\n","\n","âTheyâre friends of mine,â said Harry coldly.\n","\n","âOh,â said the girl, looking very surprised. âOh. Okay.â\n","\n","And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.\n","\n","âPeople expect you 10 have cooler friends than us,â said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.\n","\n","âYou are cool,â said Harry shortly. âNone of them was at the Ministry. They didnât fight with me.â\n","\n","âThatâs a very nice thing to say,â beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The\n","\n","Quibbler.\n","\n","âWe didnât face him, though,â said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resignedlooking Trevor in his hand. âYou did. You should hear my gran talk about you. âThat Harry Potterâs got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!â Sheâd give anything to have you as a grandsonâ¦\n","\n","Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT, with only an âAcceptable,â Harry watched him without really listening.\n","\n","Nevilleâs childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harryâs had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harryâs destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.\n","\n","Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightningshaped scar and the weight of the prophecyâ¦ Or would it? Would Nevilleâs mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she wouldâ¦ But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no âChosen Oneâ at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother, not Ronâs?\n","\n","âYou all right, Harry? You look funny,â said Neville.\n","\n","Harry started. âSorry â¦ I â¦â\n","\n","âWrackspurt got you?â asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.\n","\n","âIâ¦ what?â\n","\n","âA Wrackspurtâ¦ Theyâre invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,â she said. âI thought I felt one zooming around in here.â\n","\n","She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each otherâs eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.\n","\n","The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.\n","\n","âWish the lunch trolley would hurry up, Iâm starving,â said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. âHi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?â he added, turning to Harry. âMalfoy s not doing prefect duty. Heâs just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.â\n","\n","Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.\n","\n","âWhat did he do when he saw you?â\n","\n","âThe usual,â said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand\n","\n","gesture. âNot like him, though, is it? Wellâ¦ that isâ â he did the hand gesture again â âbut why isnât he out there bullying first years?\n","\n","âDunno,â said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didnât this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?\n","\n","âMaybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,â said Hermione. âMaybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.â\n","\n","âI donât think so,â said Harry. âI think heâs â¦â\n","\n","But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless thirdyear girl stepped inside.\n","\n","âIâm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry PPotter,â she faltered, as her eyes met Harryâs and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.\n","\n","âWhat is it?â Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\n","\n","âAn invitation,â said Harry.\n","\n","Harry,\n","\n","I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\n","\n","Sincerely, Horace\n","\n","âBut what does he want me for?â asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\n","\n","âNo idea,â said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. âListen,â he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, âletâs go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what heâs up to.â\n","\n","This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.\n","\n","When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughornâs only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughornâs welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\n","\n","âHarry, mâboy!â said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvetcovered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden\n","\n","buttons on his waistcoat. âGood to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!â\n","\n","Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventhyear boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.\n","\n","âNow, do you know everyone?â Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. âBlaise Zabini is in your year, of course ââ\n","\n","Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.\n","\n","âThis is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps youâve come across each other â¦ ? No?â\n","\n","McLaggen, a large, wiryhaired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\n","\n","ââ¦ and this is Marcus Belby, I donât know whether â¦?â\n","\n","Belby, who was thin and nervouslooking, gave a strained smile.\n","\n","ââ¦ and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!â Slughorn finished.\n","\n","Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughornâs back.\n","\n","âWell now, this is most pleasant,â said Slughorn cozily. âA chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. Iâve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on\n","\n","licorice wands, and a poor old manâs digestive system isnât quite up to such thingsâ¦ Pheasant, Belby?â\n","\n","Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.\n","\n","âI was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,â Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. âOutstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most welldeserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?â\n","\n","Unfortunately, Beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.\n","\n","âAnapneo,â said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.\n","\n","âNotâ¦ not much of him, no,â gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.\n","\n","âWell, of course, I daresay heâs busy,â said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. âI doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!â\n","\n","âI supposeâ¦â said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. âErâ¦ he and my dad donât get on very well, you see, so I donât really know much aboutâ¦â\n","\n","His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.\n","\n","âNow, you, Cormac,â said Slughorn, âI happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?â\n","\n","âOh, yeah, that was fun, that was,â said McLaggen. âWe went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously â¦â\n","\n","âAh, you know Bertie and Rufus too?â beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. âNow tell meâ¦â\n","\n","It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influentialâ¦ everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Nevilleâs turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Nevilleâs parents, wellknown Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Nevilleâs interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parentsâ flair.\n","\n","âAnd now,â said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. âHarry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!â He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, ââThe Chosen One,â theyâre calling you now!â\n","\n","Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.\n","\n","âOf course,â said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, âthere have been rumors for yearsâ¦ I remember when â¦ well â¦ after that terrible night â¦ Lily â¦ James â¦ and you survived â¦ and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary â¦â\n","\n","Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to\n","\n","indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn.\n","\n","âYeah, Zabini, because youâre so talentedâ¦ at posingâ¦â\n","\n","âOh dear!â chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughornâs great belly. âYou want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous BatBogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldnât cross her!â\n","\n","Zabini merely looked contemptuous.\n","\n","âAnyway,â said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. âSuch rumors this summer. Of course, one doesnât know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes â¦ but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!â\n","\n","Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.\n","\n","âSo modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond â¦ you were there, then? But the rest of the stories â¦ so sensational, of course, one doesnât know quite what to believe â¦ this fabled prophecy, for instance â¦â\n","\n","âWe never heard a prophecy,â said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it.\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Ginny staunchly. âNeville and I were both there too, and all this âChosen Oneâ rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.â\n","\n","âYou were both there too, were you?â said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile.\n","\n","âYesâ¦ wellâ¦ it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of courseâ¦â Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. âI remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) â¦â\n","\n","He meandered off into a longwinded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.\n","\n","The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the âSlug Clubâ at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldnât see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.\n","\n","âGood gracious, itâs getting dark already! I didnât notice that theyâd lit the lamps! Youâd better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise â¦ any time youâre passing. Same goes for you, miss,â he twinkled at Ginny. âWell, off you go, off you go!â\n","\n","As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.\n","\n","âIâm glad thatâs over,â muttered Neville. âStrange man, isnât he?â âYeah, he is a bit,â said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. âHow come you ended up in there, Ginny?â\n","\n","âHe saw me hex Zacharias Smith,â said Ginny. âYou remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him â¦ when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to got detention, but he just thought it was ;i really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?â\n","\n","âBetter reason for inviting someone than because their motherâs famous,â said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabiniâs head, âor because their uncleâ¦â\n","\n","But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful ideaâ¦ In a minuteâs time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixthyear compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherinsâ¦ If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left â¦ Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows â¦ but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harryâs suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.\n","\n","âIâll see you two later,â said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.\n","\n","âBut whatâre you â¦ ?â asked Neville.\n","\n","âLater!â whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.\n","\n","The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.\n","\n","âWhatâs wrong with this thing?â said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harryâs foot.\n","\n","Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyleâs lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabiniâs temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoyâs eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoyâs forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbeâs comic directly\n","\n","below him.\n","\n","âSo, Zabini,â said Malfoy, âwhat did Slughorn want?â\n","\n","âJust trying to make up to wellconnected people,â said Zabini,\n","\n","who was still glowering at Goyle. âNot that he managed to find\n","\n","many.â\n","\n","This information did not seem to please Malfoy. âWho else had he invited?â he demanded.\n","\n","âMcLaggen from Gryffindor,â said Zabini.\n","\n","âOh yeah, his uncleâs big in the Ministry,â said Malfoy.\n","\n","ââ¦ someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw â¦â\n","\n","âNot him, heâs a prat!â said Pansy.\n","\n","ââ¦ and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,â finished Zabini.\n","\n","Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansyâs hand aside.\n","\n","âHe invited Longbottom?.â\n","\n","âWell, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,â said Zabini indifferently.\n","\n","âWhatâs Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?â\n","\n","Zabini shrugged.\n","\n","âPotter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at âthe Chosen One,ââ sneered Malfoy, âbut that Weasley girl! Whatâs so special about her?â\n","\n","âA lot of boys like her,â said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. âEven you think sheâs goodlooking, donât you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!\n","\n","âI wouldnât touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,â said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.\n","\n","âWell, I pity Slughornâs taste. Maybe heâs going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasnât heard Iâm on the train, orâ¦â\n","\n","âI wouldnât bank on an invitation,â said Zabini. âHe asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old\n","\n","friends, apparently, but when he heard heâd been caught at the Ministry he didnât look happy, and Nott didnât get an invitation, did he? 1 donât think Slughornâs interested in Death Eaters.â\n","\n","Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.\n","\n","âWell, who cares what heâs interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.â Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. âI mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, whatâs it matter to me if some fat old hasbeen likes me or not?â\n","\n","âWhat do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?â said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.\n","\n","âWell, you never know,â said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. âI might have â¦ er â¦ moved on to bigger and better things.â\n","\n","Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harryâs heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded.\n","\n","âDo you meanâ¦â\n","\n","Malfoy shrugged.\n","\n","âMother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I donât see it as that important these days. I mean, think about itâ¦ When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N.E.W.T.S anyoneâs got? Of course he isnât. Itâll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.â\n","\n","âAnd you think youâll be able to do something for him?â asked\n","\n","Zabini scathingly. âSixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet?â\n","\n","âIâve just said, havenât I? Maybe he doesnât care if Iâm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isnât something that you need to be qualified for,â said Malfoy quietly.\n","\n","Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so aweinspiring.\n","\n","âI can see Hogwarts,â said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. âWeâd better get our robes on.â\n","\n","Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\n","\n","Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.\n","\n","Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\n","\n","into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.\n","\n","âYou go on,â Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. âI just want to check something.â\n","\n","Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.\n","\n","Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?\n","\n","âPetrificus Totalus!â\n","\n","Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floorshaking crash, at Malfoyâs feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldnât move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.\n","\n","âI thought so,â he said jubilantly. âI heard Goyleâs trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came backâ¦â\n","\n","His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harryâs trainers.\n","\n","âYou didnât hear anything I care about, Potter. But while Iâve got you hereâ¦â\n","\n","And he stamped, hard, on Harryâs face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.\n","\n","âThatâs from my father. Now, letâs seeâ¦â\n","\n","Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harryâs immobilized body and threw it over him.\n","\n","âI donât reckon theyâll find you till the trains back in London,â he said quietly. âSee you around, Potterâ¦ or not.â\n","\n","And taking care to tread on Harryâs fingers, Malfoy left the compartment.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 8 â Victorious Snape\n","\n","\n","Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone would, surely check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him.\n","\n","Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself inâ¦ and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.\n","\n","Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.\n","\n","He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words âAccio Wand!â over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.\n","\n","He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the faroff hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestraldrawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.\n","\n","The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on itâ¦\n","\n","Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, âWotcher, Harry.â\n","\n","There was a flash of red light and Harryâs body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiy Cloak she had just pulled away.\n","\n","Weâd better get out of here, quickly,â she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. âCome on, weâll jump.â\n","\n","Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.\n","\n","The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.\n","\n","âWho did it?â\n","\n","âDraco Malfoy,â said Harry bitterly. âThanks forâ¦ wellâ¦â\n","\n","âNo problem,â said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousyhaired and miserablelookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. âI can fix your nose if you stand still.â\n","\n","Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stockstill and closed his eyes,\n","\n","âEpiskeyâ said Tonks.\n","\n","Harryâs nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt gingerly. It seemed to be mended.\n","\n","âThanks a lot!â\n","\n","âYouâd better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,â said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery fourlegged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.\n","\n","âWas that a Patronus?â asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\n","\n","âYes, Iâm sending word to the castle that Iâve got you or theyâll worry. Come on, weâd better not dawdle.â\n","\n","They set off toward the lane that led to the school.\n","\n","âHow did you find me?â\n","\n","âI noticed you hadnât left the train and I knew you had that cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought Iâd check.â\n","\n","âBut what are you doing here, anyway?â Harry asked.\n","\n","âIâm stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,â said Tonks.\n","\n","âIs it just you whoâs stationed up here, or â ?â\n","\n","âNo, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.â\n","\n","âDawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?â\n","\n","âThatâs right.â\n","\n","They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadnât been her fault at all, but he couldnât bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Siriusâs death; it was no more her fault than anyone elseâs (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonksâs long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.\n","\n","Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.\n","\n","âAlohomora!â he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.\n","\n","âThat wonât work on these,â said Tonks. âDumbledore bewitched them himself.â\n","\n","Harry looked around, I could climb a wall,â he suggested.\n","\n","âNo, you couldnât,â said Tonks flatly. âAntiintruder jinxes on all of them. Securityâs been tightened a hundredfold this summer.â\n","\n","âWell then,â said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, âI suppose Iâll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.â\n","\n","âSomeoneâs coming down for you,â said Tonks, âLook.â\n","\n","A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filchâs wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.\n","\n","âWell, well, well,â sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. âNice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.â\n","\n","âI couldnât change, I didnât have my ââ Harry began, but Snape cut across him.\n","\n","âThere is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite â ah\n","\n","â safe in my hands.â\n","\n","âI meant Hagrid to get the message,â said Tonks, frowning.\n","\n","âHagrid was late for the startofterm feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,â said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, âI was interested to see your new Patronus.â\n","\n","He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into place.\n","\n","âI think you were better off with the old one,â said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. âThe new one looks weak.â\n","\n","As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonksâs face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.\n","\n","âGood night,â Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Snape. âThanks for â¦ everything,â\n","\n","âSee you, Harry.â\n","\n","Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harryâs forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snapeâs snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.\n","\n","âFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,â said Snape. âAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I donât believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We havenât even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.â\n","\n","The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze whitehot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way\n","\n","back to London than tell Snape why he was late.\n","\n","âI suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?â Snape continued. âAnd with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.â\n","\n","Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening.\n","\n","They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harryâs mind, however, Snape said, âNo cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, Iâm sure.â\n","\n","Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.\n","\n","âWhereâve you â blimey, whatâve you done to your face?â said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity. I\n","\n","âWhy, whatâs wrong with it?â said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.\n","\n","âYouâre covered in blood!â said Hermione. âCome here ââ\n","\n","She raised her wand, said âTergeo!â and siphoned off the dried blood.\n","\n","âThanks,â said Harry, feeling his now clean face. âHowâs my nose looking?\n","\n","âNormal,â said Hermoine anxiously. âWhy shouldnât it? Harry, what happened? Weâve been terrified!â\n","\n","âIâll tell you later,â said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.\n","\n","âBut ââ said Hermione.\n","\n","âNot now, Hermione,â said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldnât reach too many Gryffindor ears.\n","\n","He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.\n","\n","âYou missed the Sorting, anyway,â said Hermione, as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau.\n","\n","âHat say anything interesting?â asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.\n","\n","âMore of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies, you know.â\n","\n","âDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?â\n","\n","âNot yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast doesnât he? It canât be long now.â\n","\n","âSnape said Hagrid was late for the feast ââ\n","\n","âYouâve seen Snape? How come?â said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.\n","\n","âBumped into him,â said Harry evasively.\n","\n","âHagrid was only a few minutes late,â said Hermione. âLook, heâs waving at you, Harry.â\n","\n","Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagridâs elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagridâs other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the startofterm feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harryâs parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company, thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would give to fight Malfoy oneononeâ¦\n","\n","âSo what did Professor Slughorn want?â Hermione asked.\n","\n","âTo know what really happened at the Ministry.â said Harry.\n","\n","âHim and everyone else here,â sniffed Hermione. âPeople were interrogating us about it on the train, werenât they, Ron?â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Ron. âAll wanting to know if you really are âthe Chosen Oneâ ââ\n","\n","âThere has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,â interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. âI am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. âHarry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,â I told them. âI would rather die than betray his trust.ââ\n","\n","âThatâs not saying much, seeing as youâre already dead,â Ron observed.\n","\n","âOnce again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,â said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.\n","\n","âThe very best of evenings to you!â he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.\n","\n","âWhat happened to his hand?â gasped Hermione.\n","\n","She was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledoreâs right hand was as blackened and deadlooking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers it the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purpleandgold sleeve over his injury.\n","\n","âNothing to worry about,â he said airily. âNow â¦ to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you â¦â\n","\n","âHis hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,â\n","\n","Harry whispered to Hermione. âI thought heâd have cured it by now, though â¦ or Madam Pomfrey wouldâve done.â\n","\n","âIt looks as if itâs died,â said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. âBut there are some injuries you canât cureâ¦ old cursesâ¦and there are poisons without antidotes. . . .â\n","\n","ââ¦and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleysâ Wizard Wheezes.\n","\n","âThose wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.\n","\n","âWe are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year, Professor Slughornââ Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow â âis a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.â\n","\n","âPotions?â\n","\n","âPotions?â\n","\n","The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right.\n","\n","âPotions?â said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare Harry. âBut you said ââ\n","\n","âProfessor Snape, meanwhile,â said Dumbledore, raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering, âwill be taking the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.â\n","\n","âNo!â said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadnât it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?\n","\n","âBut Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!â said Hermione.\n","\n","âI thought he was!â said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.\n","\n","Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledoreâs right, did not stand up his mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.\n","\n","âWell, thereâs one good thing,â he said savagely. âSnapeâll be gone by the end of the year.â\n","\n","âWhat do you mean?â asked Ron.\n","\n","âThat jobâs jinxed. No ones lasted more than a yearâ¦ Quirrell actually died doing itâ¦ Personally, Iâm going to keep my fingers crossed for another deathâ¦â\n","\n","âHarry!â said Hermione, shocked and reproachful.\n","\n","âHe might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,â said Ron reasonably. âThat Slughorn bloke might not want to stay longterm. Moody didnât.â\n","\n","âDumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heartâs desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.\n","\n","âNow, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.â\n","\n","The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmasterâs words unworthy of his attention.\n","\n","âI cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castleâs magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them â in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and othersâ safety.â\n","\n","Dumbledoreâs blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.\n","\n","âBut now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be wellrested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!â\n","\n","With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nosestamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefectâs duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.\n","\n","âWhat really happened to your nose?â he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.\n","\n","Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.\n","\n","âI saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,â he said darkly.\n","\n","âYeah, well, never mind that,â said Harry bitterly. âListen to what he was saying before he found out I was thereâ¦â\n","\n","âHarry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts. With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.\n","\n","âCome on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinsonâ¦.\n","\n","What kind of mission would YouKnowWho have given him?â\n","\n","âHow dâyou know Voldemort doesnât need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldnât be the first ââ\n","\n","âI wish yehâd stop sayinâ tha name, Harry,â said a reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagtid shaking his head.\n","\n","âDumbledore uses that name,â said Harry stubbornly\n","\n","âYeah, well, thaâs Dumbledore, innit?â said Hagrid mysteriously.\n","\n","âSo how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.â\n","\n","âGot held up on the train,â said Harry. âWhy were you late?â\n","\n","âI was with Grawp,â said Hagrid happily. âLosâ track oâ the time. Heâs got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it â nice big cave. Heâs much happier than he was in the forest. We were havinâ a good chat.â\n","\n","âReally?â said Harry, taking care not to catch Ronâs eye; the last time he had met Hagridâs halfbrother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.\n","\n","âOh yeah, heâs really come on,â said Hagrid proudly. âYehâll be amazed. Iâm thinkinâ oâ traininâ him up as me assistant.â\n","\n","Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.\n","\n","âAnyway, Iâll see yeh tomorrow, firsâ lessonâs straight after lunch. Come early anâ yeh can say hello ter Buck â I mean, Witherwings!â\n","\n","Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the doors into the darkness.\n","\n","Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.\n","\n","âYouâre not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?â\n","\n","Ron shook his head. âAnd youâre not either, are you?â\n","\n","Harry shook his head too.\n","\n","âAnd Hermione,â said Ron, âsheâs not, is she?â\n","\n","Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 9: The Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support in his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express.\n","\n","âBut he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasnât he?â interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything.\n","\n","âWell,â she said uncertainly, âI donât know. It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is â¦ but thatâs a big lie to tellâ¦â\n","\n","âExactly,â said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.\n","\n","âItâs rude to point,â Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule firstyear boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. âI love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.â\n","\n","âWeâre going to need that time for studying, Ron!â said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor.\n","\n","âYeah, but not today,â said Ron. âTodayâs going to be a real loss, I reckon.â\n","\n","âHold it!â said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a limegreen disk clutched tightly in his hand. âFanged Frisbees banned, hand it over,â she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermioneâs grip.\n","\n","âExcellent, Iâve always wanted one of these.â\n","\n","Hermioneâs remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ronâs remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.\n","\n","The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.\n","\n","âBut he canât really think weâd continue Care of Magical Creatures!â she said, looking distressed. âI mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?â\n","\n","âThatâs it, though, innit?â said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. âWe were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. Dâya reckon anyoneâs going to go on to N.E.W.T.?â\n","\n","Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagridâs eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.\n","\n","After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagallâs descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.\n","\n","Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L results.\n","\n","âHerbology, fine,â she said. âProfessor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an âOutstandingâ O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with âExceeds Expectations.â But the problem is Transfiguration. Iâm sorry, Longbottom, but an âAcceptableâ really isnât good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. Just donât think youâd be able to cope with the coursework.â\n","\n","Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.\n","\n","âWhy do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? Iâve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.â\n","\n","Neville looked miserable and muttered something about âmy grandmother wants.â\n","\n","âHmph,â snorted Professot McGonagall. âItâs high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson sheâs got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry.â\n","\n","Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.\n","\n","âIâm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an âExceeds Expectationsâ in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?â\n","\n","âMy grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,â mumbled Neville.\n","\n","âTake Charms,â said Professor McGonagall, âand I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.â Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Nevilleâs face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.\n","\n","Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.\n","\n","âHe and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,â said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. âThe sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.â\n","\n","Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.\n","\n","âSo, Potter, Potter . . .â said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. âCharms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration â¦ all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why havenât you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?â\n","\n","âIt was, but you told me I had to get an âOutstandingâ in my O.W.L., Professor.â\n","\n","âAnd so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with âExceeds Expectationsâ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry, âbut I didnât buy the books or any ingredients or anything-â\n","\n","âIâm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,â said Professor McGonagall. âVery well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.â\n","\n","A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together.\n","\n","âLook,â said Ron delightedly, gazing ar his schedule, âweâve got a free period now. . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent.â\n","\n","They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.\n","\n","âI thought youâd get that, well done,â she called over, pointing at the Captains badge on Harryâs chest. âTell me when you call trials!â\n","\n","âDonât be stupid,â said Harry, âyou donât need to try out, I watched you play for five years. . . .â\n","\n","âYou mustnât start off like that,â she said warningly. âFor all you know, thereâs someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friendsâ¦.â\n","\n","Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourthyear student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanksâs yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.\n","\n","An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking putupon.\n","\n","âWe got so much homework for Runes,â she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her. âA fifteeninch essay, two translations, and Iâve got to read these by Wednesday!â\n","\n","âShame,â yawned Ron.\n","\n","âYou wait,â she said resentfully. âI bet Snape gives us loads.â\n","\n","The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\n","\n","âInside,â he said.\n","\n","Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\n","\n","âI have not asked you to take out your books,â said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. âI wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.â\n","\n","His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harryâs than anyone elseâs.\n","\n","âYou have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.â\n","\n","You believe . . . like you havenât watched them all come and go, hoping youâd be next, thought Harry scathingly.\n","\n","âNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be more advanced.â\n","\n","Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. âThe Dark Arts,â said Snape, âare many, varied, everchanging, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a manyheaded monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.â\n","\n","Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?\n","\n","âYour defenses,â said Snape, a little louder, âmust therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These picturesâ - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - âgive a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curseâ - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - âfeel the Dementorâs Kissâ - a wizard lying huddled and blankeyed, slumped against a wall - âor provoke the aggression of the Inferiusâ - a bloody mass upon ground.\n","\n","âHas an Inferius been seen, then?â said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice. âIs it definite, is he using them?â\n","\n","âThe Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,â said Snape, âwhich means you would be welladvised to assume he might use them again. Now. . . â\n","\n","He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him. ,\n","\n","â. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?â\n","\n","Hermioneâs hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, âVery well - Miss Granger?â\n","\n","âYour adversary has no warning about what kind of magic youâre about to perform,â said Hermione, âwhich gives you a splitsecond advantage.â\n","\n","âAn answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,â said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), âbut correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spellcasting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which someâ - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - âlack.â\n","\n","Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.\n","\n","âYou will now divide,â Snape went on, âinto pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.â\n","\n","Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Nevilleâs muttered JellyLegs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.\n","\n","Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.\n","\n","âPathetic, Weasley,â said Snape, after a while. âHere â let me show you-â\n","\n","He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, âProtego!â\n","\n","His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked offbalance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.\n","\n","âDo you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry stiffly.\n","\n","âYes, sir.â\n","\n","âThereâs no need to call me âsir,â Professor.â The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.\n","\n","âDetention, Saturday night, my office,â said Snape. âI do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even âthe Chosen One.ââ\n","\n","âThat was brilliant, Harry!â chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later.\n","\n","âYou really shouldnât have said it,â said Hermione, frowning at Ron. âWhat made you?â\n","\n","âHe tried to jinx me, in case you didnât notice!â fumed Harry. I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesnât he use another guinea pig for a change? Whatâs Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructble stuff ââ\n","\n","âWell,â said Hermione, âI thought he sounded a bit like you.â\n","\n","âLike me?â\n","\n","âYes, when you were telling us what itâs like to face Voldemort. You said it wasnât just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts - well, wasnât that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quickthinking?â\n","\n","Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.\n","\n","âHarry! Hey, Harry!â\n","\n","Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last yearâs Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.\n","\n","âFor you,â panted Sloper. âListen, I heard youâre the new Captain. Whenâre you holding trials?â\n","\n","âIâm not sure yet,â said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. âIâll let you know.â\n","\n","âOh, right. I was hoping itâd be this weekend -â\n","\n","âBut Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in midsentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.\n","\n","Dear Harry, I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.\n","\n","Yours sincerely,\n","\n","Albus Dumbledore P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\n","\n","âHe enjoys Acid Pops?â said Ron, who had read the message over Harryâs shoulder and was looking perplexed.\n","\n","âItâs the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,â said Harry in a low voice. âHa! Snapeâs not going to be pleased. . . . I wonât be able to do his detention!â\n","\n","He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snapeâs homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their afterlunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoonâs double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snapeâs.\n","\n","When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.\n","\n","âHarry,â Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, âdidnât get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron â Hermione?â\n","\n","Before they could say more than âfine,â the dungeon door opened and Slughornâs belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.\n","\n","The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a goldcolored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potionâs fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.\n","\n","âNow then, now then, now then,â said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. âScales out, everyone, and potion kits, and donât forget your copies\n","\n","of Advanced PotionMaking. . . .â\n","\n","âSir?â said Harry, raising his hand.\n","\n","âHarry, mâboy?â\n","\n","âI havenât got a book or scales or anything - norâs Ron - we didnât realize weâd be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see -â\n","\n","âAh, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and Iâm sure we can lend you some scales, and weâve got a small stock of old books here, theyâll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .â\n","\n","Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a momentâs foraging, emerged with two very batteredlooking copies of Advanced PotionMaking by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.\n","\n","âNow then,â said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, âIâve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of âem, even if you havenât made âem yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?â\n","\n","He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.\n","\n","Hermioneâs wellpracticed hand hit the air before anybody elseâs; Slughorn pointed at her.\n","\n","âItâs Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth,â said Hermione.\n","\n","âVery good, very good!â said Slughorn happily. âNow,â he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, âthis one here is pretty well knownâ¦ Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately tooâ¦ Who can - ?â\n","\n","Hermioneâs hand was fastest once more.\n","\n","âltâs Polyjuice Potion, sir,â she said.\n","\n","Harry too had recognized the slowbubbling, mudlike substance the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. âExcellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?â said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermioneâs hand punched the air again.\n","\n","âItâs Amortentia!â\n","\n","âIt is indeed. Ir seems almost foolish to ask,â said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, âbut I assume you know what it does?â\n","\n","âItâs the most powerful love porion in the world!â said Hermione.\n","\n","âQuite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive motherofpearl sheen?â\n","\n","âAnd the steam rising in characteristic spirals,â said Hermione enthusiastically, âand itâs supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and -â\n","\n","But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.\n","\n","âMay I ask your name, my dear?â said Slughorn, ignoring Hermioneâs embarrassment.\n","\n","âHermione Granger, sir.â\n","\n","âGranger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector DagworthGranger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?â\n","\n","âNo. I donât think so, sir. Iâm Muggleborn, you see.â\n","\n","Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.\n","\n","âOho! âOne of my best friends is Muggleborn, and sheâs the best in our year!â Iâm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?â\n","\n","âYes, sir,â said Harry.\n","\n","âWell, well, take twenty wellearned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,â said Slughorn genially.\n","\n","Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, âDid you really tell him Iâm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!â\n","\n","âWell, whatâs so impressive about that?â whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. âYou are the best in the year - Iâd've told him so if heâd asked me!â\n","\n","Hermione smiled but made a âshhingâ gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.\n","\n","âAmortentia doesnât really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes,â he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. âWhen you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.â\n","\n","âAnd now,â said Slughorn, âit is time for us to start work.â\n","\n","âSir, you havenât told us whatâs in this one,â said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughornâs desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.\n","\n","âOho,â said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. âYes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,â he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, âthat you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?â\n","\n","âItâs liquid luck,â said Hermione excitedly. âIt makes you lucky!â\n","\n","The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.\n","\n","âQuite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, itâs a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,â said Slughorn. âDesperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed â¦ at least until the effects wear off.â\n","\n","âWhy donât people drink it all the time, sir?â said Terry Boot eagerly.\n","\n","âBecause if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,â said Slughorn. âToo much of a good thing, you know. . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . .â\n","\n","âHave you ever taken it, sir?â asked Michael Corner with great interest.\n","\n","âTwice in my life,â said Slughorn. âOnce when I was twentyfour, once when I was fiftyseven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.â\n","\n","He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.\n","\n","âAnd that,â said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, âis what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.â\n","\n","There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.\n","\n","âOne tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,â said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. âEnough for twelve hoursâ luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.â\n","\n","âNow, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!â\n","\n","âSo,â said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, âhow are you to win this fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!â\n","\n","There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking., It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.\n","\n","To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up Valerian roots as fast as he could.\n","\n","Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the âsmooth, black currantcolored liquidâ mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.\n","\n","Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:\n","\n","Crush with flat side of silver dagger,\n","\n","releases juice better than cutting.\n","\n","âSir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?â Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.\n","\n","âYes,â said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, âI was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasnât unexpected, dragon pox at his ageâ¦â\n","\n","And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.\n","\n","The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.\n","\n","âCan I borrow your silver knife?â\n","\n","She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.\n","\n","Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all.\n","\n","Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.\n","\n","His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?\n","\n","Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned pale pink.\n","\n","âHow are you doing that?â demanded Hermione, who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.\n","\n","âAdd a clockwise stir -â\n","\n","âNo, no, the book says counterclockwise!â she snapped.\n","\n","Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterdockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .\n","\n","Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one elseâs potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.\n","\n","âAnd timeâs . . . up!â called Slughorn. âStop stirring, please!â\n","\n","Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ronâs cauldron. He passed over Ernieâs navy concoction. Hermioneâs potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harryâs, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.\n","\n","âThe clear winner!â he cried to the dungeon. âExcellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, itâs clear youâve inherited your motherâs talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!â\n","\n","Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherinsâ faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermioneâs. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.\n","\n","âHow did you do that?â he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.\n","\n","âGot lucky, I suppose,â said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.\n","\n","Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermioneâs face became stonier with every word he uttered.\n","\n","âI sâpose you think I cheated?â he finished, aggravated by her expression.\n","\n","âWell, it wasnât exactly your own work, was it?â she said stiffly.\n","\n","âHe only followed different instructions to ours,â said Ron, âCouldâve been a catastrophe, couldnât it? But he took a risk and it paid off.â He heaved a sigh. âSlughorn couldâve handed me that book, but no, I get the one no oneâs ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fiftytwo, but-â\n","\n","âHang on,â said a voice close by Harryâs left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughornâs dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. âDid I hear right? Youâve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?â\n","\n","She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.\n","\n","âItâs nothing,â he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. âItâs not like, you know, Riddleâs diary. Itâs just an old textbook someoneâs scribbled on.â\n","\n","âBut youâre doing what it says?â\n","\n","âI just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, thereâs nothing funny -â\n","\n","âGinnyâs got a point,â said Hermione, perking up at once. âWe ought to check that thereâs nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?â\n","\n","âHey!â said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and raised her wand. âSpecialis Revelio!â she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dogeared.\n","\n","âFinished?â said Harry irritably. âOr dâyou want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?â\n","\n","âIt seems all right,â said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. âI mean, it really does seem to be â¦ just a textbook.â\n","\n","âGood. Then Iâll have it back,â said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.\n","\n","This book is the property of the Half Blood Prince.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 10: The Hour of Gaunt\n","\n","\n","For or the rest of the weekâs Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the HalfBlood Princeâs instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borageâs, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the âofficialâ instructions, but becoming increasingly badtempered as they yielded poorer results than the Princeâs.\n","\n","Harry wondered vaguely who the HalfBlood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced PotionMaking, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potionmaking. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.\n","\n","âOr herself,â said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. âIt might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girlâs than a boyâs.â\n","\n","âThe HalfBlood Prince, he was called,â Harry said. âHow many girls have been Princes?â\n","\n","Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down.\n","\n","Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking back into his bag.\n","\n","âItâs five to eight, Iâd better go, Iâll be late for Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âOoooh!â gasped Hermione, looking up at once. âGood luck! Weâll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!â\n","\n","âHope it goes okay,â said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole.\n","\n","Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirtylooking playing cards, reading them as she walked.\n","\n","âTwo of spades: conflict,â she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. âSeven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner ââ\n","\n","She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harryâs statue.\n","\n","âWell, that canât be right,â she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventhfloor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.\n","\n","âAcid Pops,â said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledoreâs Office.\n","\n","Harry knocked.\n","\n","âCome in,â said Dumbledore s voice.\n","\n","âGood evening, sir,â said Harry, walking into the headmasterâs office.\n","\n","âAh, good evening, Harry. Sit down,â said Dumbledore, smiling. âI hope youâve had an enjoyable first week back at school?â âYes, thanks, sir,â said Harry.\n","\n","âYou must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!â âEr,â began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern.\n","\n","âI have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledoreâs magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.\n","\n","âSo, Harry,â said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. âYou have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these â for want of a better word â lessons?â\n","\n","âYes, sir.â\n","\n","âWell, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.â There was a pause.\n","\n","âYou said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,â said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. âSir,â he added.\n","\n","âAnd so I did,â said Dumbledore placidly. âI told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.â\n","\n","âBut you think youâre right?â said Harry.\n","\n","âNaturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being â forgive me â rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.â\n","\n","âSir,â said Harry tentatively, âdoes what youâre going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?â\n","\n","âIt has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,â said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather, âand I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.â\n","\n","Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.\n","\n","âYou look worried.â\n","\n","Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling.\n","\n","âThis time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.â\n","\n","âWhere are we going, sir?â\n","\n","âFor a trip down Bob Ogdenâs memory lane,â said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silverywhite substance.\n","\n","âWho was Bob Ogden?â\n","\n","âHe was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,â said Dumbledore. âHe died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry â¦â\n","\n","But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.\n","\n","âShall âshall I, sir?â\n","\n","âNo matter, Harry ââ\n","\n","Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.\n","\n","âSir â how did you injure your hand?â Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.\n","\n","âNow is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.â\n","\n","Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas. âAfter you,â said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl. Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.\n","\n","They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forgetmenot. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the lefthand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped onepiece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.\n","\n","Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile.\n","\n","They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frockcoated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.\n","\n","Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogdenâs frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.\n","\n","Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.\n","\n","Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harryâs eyes discerned the building halfhidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.\n","\n","Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.\n","\n","Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled.\n","\n","âYouâre not welcome.â\n","\n","The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke.\n","\n","âEr â good morning. Iâm from the Ministry of Magic ââ âYouâre not welcome.â\n","\n","âEr â Iâm sorry â I donât understand you,â said Ogden nervously.\n","\n","Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harryâs opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.\n","\n","âYou understand him, Iâm sure, Harry?â said Dumbledore quietly. âYes, of course,â said Harry, slightly nonplussed. âWhy canât Ogden â ?â\n","\n","But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.\n","\n","âHeâs speaking Parseltongue?â\n","\n","âVery good,â said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.\n","\n","The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.\n","\n","âNow, look ââ Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.\n","\n","âMorfin!â said a loud voice.\n","\n","An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground.\n","\n","âMinistry, is it?â said the older man, looking down at Ogden. âCorrect!â said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. âAnd you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?â\n","\n","âSâright,â said Gaunt. âGot you in the face, did he?â âYes, he did!â snapped Ogden.\n","\n","âShouldâve made your presence known, shouldnât you?â said Gaunt aggressively. âThis is private property. Canât just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.â\n","\n","âDefend himself against what, man?â said Ogden, clambering back to his feet.\n","\n","âBusybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.â Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin. âGet in the house. Donât argue.â\n","\n","This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again.\n","\n","âItâs your son Iâm here to see, Mr. Gaunt,â said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. âThat was Morfin, wasnât it?â\n","\n","âAh, that was Morfin,â said the old man indifferently. âAre you pureblood?â he asked, suddenly aggressive.\n","\n","âThatâs neither here nor there,â said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently.\n","\n","He squinted into Ogdenâs face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, âNow I come to think about it, Iâve seen noses like yours down in the village.â\n","\n","âI donât doubt it, if your sonâs been let loose on them,â said Ogden. âPerhaps we could continue this discussion inside?â\n","\n","âInside?â\n","\n","âYes, Mr. Gaunt. Iâve already told you. Iâm here about Morfin. We sent an owl ââ\n","\n","âIâve no use for owls,â said Gaunt. âI donât open letters.â\n","\n","âThen you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,â said Ogden tartly. âI am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning ââ\n","\n","âAll right, all right, all right!â bellowed Gaunt. âCome in the bleeding house, then, and much good itâll do you!â\n","\n","The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:\n","\n","Hissy, hissy, little snakey, Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or heâll nail you to the door.\n","\n","There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalidlooking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brotherâs, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeatedlooking person.\n","\n","âMâdaughter, Merope,â said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her.\n","\n","âGood morning,â said Ogden.\n","\n","She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.\n","\n","âWell, Mr. Gaunt,â said Ogden, âto get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.â\n","\n","There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots.\n","\n","âPick it up!â Gaunt bellowed at her. âThatâs it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, whatâs your wand for, you useless sack of muck?â\n","\n","âMr. Gaunt, please!â said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.\n","\n","Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, âMend it, you pointless lump, mend it!â\n","\n","Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, âReparo. â The pot mended itself instantly.\n","\n","Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, âLucky the nice man from the Ministryâs here, isnât it? Perhaps heâll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesnât mind dirty Squibs. . . .â\n","\n","Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish.\n","\n","âMr. Gaunt,â Ogden began again, âas Iâve said: the reason for my visit ââ\n","\n","âI heard you the first time!â snapped Gaunt. âAnd so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him â what about it, then?â\n","\n","âMorfin has broken Wizarding law,â said Ogden sternly.\n","\n","ââMorfin has broken Wizarding law.ââ Gaunt imitated Ogdenâs voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. âHe taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, thatâs illegal now, is it?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Ogden. âIâm afraid it is.â\n","\n","He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it.\n","\n","âWhatâs that, then, his sentence?â said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily.\n","\n","âIt is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing ââ\n","\n","âSummons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?â\n","\n","âIâm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,â said Ogden.\n","\n","âAnd you think weâre scum, do you?â screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellownailed finger pointing at his chest. âScum whoâll come running when the Ministry tells âem to? Do you know who youâre talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?â\n","\n","âI was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,â said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground.\n","\n","âThatâs right!â roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, blackstoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogdenâs eyes. âSee this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries itâs been in our family, thatâs how far back we go, and pureblood all the way! Know how much Iâve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?â\n","\n","âIâve really no idea,â said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, âand itâs quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed ââ\n","\n","With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck.\n","\n","âSee this?â he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath.\n","\n","âI see it, I see it!â said Ogden hastily.\n","\n","âSlytherins!â yelled Gaunt. âSalazar Slytherinâs! Weâre his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?â\n","\n","âMr. Gaunt, your daughter!â said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.\n","\n","âSo!â said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. âDonât you go talking to us as if weâre dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all â more than you can say, I donât doubt!â\n","\n","And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.\n","\n","âMr. Gaunt,â said Ogden doggedly, âI am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our informationâ â he glanced down at his scroll of parchment â âis that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.â\n","\n","Morfin giggled.\n","\n","âBe quiet, boy,â snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again.\n","\n","âAnd so what if he did, then?â Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden, âI expect youâve wiped the Muggleâs filthy face clean for him, and his memory to bootââ\n","\n","âThatâs hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?â said Ogden. âThis was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless ââ\n","\n","âAr, I had you marked out as a Mugglelover the moment I saw you,â sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again.\n","\n","âThis discussion is getting us nowhere,â said Ogden firmly. âIt is clear from your sonâs attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.â He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. âMorfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg ââ\n","\n","Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white.\n","\n","âMy God, what an eyesore!â rang out a girlâs voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. âCouldnât your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?â\n","\n","âItâs not ours,â said a young manâs voice. âEverything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The sonâs quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village ââ\n","\n","The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair. âKeep your seat,â said his father warningly, in Parseltongue.\n","\n","âTom,â said the girlâs voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, âI might be wrong â but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?â\n","\n","âGood lord, youâre right!â said the manâs voice. âThatâll be the son, I told you heâs not right in the head. Donât look at it, Cecilia, darling.â\n","\n","The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again.\n","\n","ââDarling,ââ whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. ââDarling, he called her. So he wouldnât have you anyway.â\n","\n","Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.\n","\n","âWhatâs that?â said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. âWhat did you say, Morfin?â\n","\n","âShe likes looking at that Muggle,â said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. âAlways in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isnât she? And last night â â\n","\n","Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, âHanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasnât she?â\n","\n","âHanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?â said Gaunt quietly.\n","\n","All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.\n","\n","âIs it true?â said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. âMy daughterâpureblooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin â hankering after a filthy, dirtveined Muggle?â\n","\n","Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak.\n","\n","âBut I got him, Father!â cackled Morfin. âI got him as he went by and he didnât look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?â\n","\n","âYou disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!â roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughterâs throat.\n","\n","Both Harry and Ogden yelled âNo!â at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, âRelaskio!â\n","\n","Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.\n","\n","Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Meropeâs screams echoing in his ears.\n","\n","Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, darkhaired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horseâs flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pellmell up the lane.\n","\n","âI think that will do, Harry,â said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledoreâs now twilit office.\n","\n","âWhat happened to the girl in the cottage?â said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. âMerope, or whatever her name was?â\n","\n","âOh, she survived,â said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. âOgden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.â\n","\n","âMarvolo?â Harry repeated wonderingly.\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. âI am glad to see youâre keeping up.â\n","\n","âThat old man was â ?â\n","\n","âVoldemortâs grandfather, yes,â said Dumbledore. âMarvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.â\n","\n","âSo Merope,â said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, âso Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemortâs mother?â\n","\n","âIt does,â said Dumbledore. âAnd it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemortâs father. I wonder whether you noticed?â\n","\n","âThe Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?â\n","\n","âVery good indeed,â said Dumbledore, beaming. âYes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.â\n","\n","âAnd they ended up married?â Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.\n","\n","âI think you are forgetting,â said Dumbledore, âthat Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.â\n","\n","âCan you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?â\n","\n","âThe Imperius Curse?â Harry suggested. âOr a love potion?â\n","\n","âVery good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squireâs son ran off with the trampâs daughter, Merope.â\n","\n","âBut the villagersâ shock was nothing to Marvoloâs. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.â\n","\n","âFrom all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death â or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.â\n","\n","âAnd Merope? She â¦ she died, didnât she? Wasnât Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?â\n","\n","âYes, indeed,â said Dumbledore. âWe must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being âhoodwinkedâ and âtaken in.â What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.â\n","\n","âBut she did have his baby.â\n","\n","âBut not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.â\n","\n","âWhat went wrong?â asked Harry. âWhy did the love potion stop working?â\n","\n","âAgain, this is guesswork,â said Dumbledore, âbut I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the babyâs sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.â\n","\n","The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledoreâs office seemed to glow more brightly than before.\n","\n","âI think that will do for tonight, Harry,â said Dumbledore after a moment or two.\n","\n","âYes, sir,â said Harry.\n","\n","He got to his feet, but did not leave.\n","\n","âSir â¦ is it important to know all this about Voldemortâs past?â\n","\n","âVery important, I think,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âAnd itâ¦ itâs got something to do with the prophecy?â\n","\n","âIt has everything to do with the prophecy.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.\n","\n","He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. âSir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything youâve told me?â\n","\n","Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, âYes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemortâs secrets.â\n","\n","âNo, sir, Iâll make sure itâs just Ron and Hermione. Good night.â\n","\n","He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindlelegged tables that supported so many fraillooking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone.\n","\n","âSir,â said Harry, staring at it. âThat ringââ\n","\n","âYes?â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âYou were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.â\n","\n","âSo I was,â Dumbledore agreed.\n","\n","âBut isnât itâ¦ sir, isnât it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?â\n","\n","Dumbledore bowed his head. âThe very same.â\n","\n","âBut how come â ? Have you always had it?â\n","\n","âNo, I acquired it very recently,â said Dumbledore. âA few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncleâs, in fact.â\n","\n","âThat would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?â\n","\n","âAround that time, yes, Harry.â\n","\n","Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.\n","\n","âSir, how exactly â ?â\n","\n","âToo late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.â\n","\n","âGood night, sir.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 11: Hermioneâs helping hand\n","\n","\n","As Hermione had predicted, the sixth yearsâ free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermioneâs increasing resentment, Harryâs best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the HalfBlood Prince.\n","\n","Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on UNoPoo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.\n","\n","One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.\n","\n","âWeâve got to go and explain,â said Hermione, looking up at Hagridâs huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.\n","\n","âWeâve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!â said Ron. âAnd weâre supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?â\n","\n","âWe didnât hate it!â said Hermione.\n","\n","âSpeak for yourself, I havenât forgotten the skrewts,â said Ron darkly. âAnd Iâm telling you now, weâve had a narrow escape. You didnât hear him going on about his gormless brother â weâd have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if weâd stayed.â\n","\n","âI hate not talking to Hagrid,â said Hermione, looking upset.\n","\n","âWeâll go down after Quidditch,â Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. âBut trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied.â He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. âI dunno why the teamâs this popular all of a sudden.â\n","\n","âOh, come on, Harry,â said Hermione, suddenly impatient. âItâs not Quidditch thatâs popular, itâs you! Youâve never been more interesting, and frankly, youâve never been more fanciable.â\n","\n","Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry.\n","\n","âEveryone knows youâve been telling the truth now, donât they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now theyâre calling you âthe Chosen Oneâ â well, come on, canât you see why people are fascinated by you?â\n","\n","Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.\n","\n","âAnd youâve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. â¦â\n","\n","âYou can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,â said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.\n","\n","âAnd it doesnât hurt that youâve grown about a foot over the summer either,â Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.\n","\n","âIâm tall,â said Ron inconsequentially.\n","\n","The post owls arrived, swooping down through rainflecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon.\n","\n","âHa!â said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced PotionMaking, fresh from Flourish and Blotts.\n","\n","âOh good,â said Hermione, delighted. âNow you can give that graffitied copy back.â\n","\n","âAre you mad?â said Harry. âIâm keeping it! Look, Iâve thought it out ââ\n","\n","He pulled the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, âDijjindo!â The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brandnew book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, âReparo!â\n","\n","There sat the Princeâs copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand.\n","\n","âIâll give Slughorn back the new one, he canât complain, it cost nine Galleons.â\n","\n","Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that dayâs copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page.\n","\n","âAnyone we know dead?â asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper.\n","\n","âNo, but there have been more dementor attacks,â said Hermione. âAnd an arrest.â\n","\n","âExcellent, who?â said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange. âStan Shunpike,â said Hermione.\n","\n","âWhat?â said Harry, startled.\n","\n","ââStanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home. . .ââ\n","\n","âStan Shunpike, a Death Eater?â said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. âNo way!â\n","\n","âHe might have been put under the Imperius Curse,â said Ron reasonably. âYou never can tell.â\n","\n","âIt doesnât look like it,â said Hermione, who was still reading. âIt says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eatersâ secret plans in a pub.â She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. âIf he was under the Imperius Curse, heâd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?â\n","\n","âIt sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,â said Ron. âIsnât he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?â\n","\n","âYeah, thatâs him,â said Harry. âI dunno what theyâre playing at, taking Stan seriously.â\n","\n","âThey probably want to look as though theyâre doing something,â said Hermione, frowning. âPeople are terrified â you know the Patil twinsâ parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.â\n","\n","âWhat!â said Ron, goggling at Hermione. âBut Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! Weâve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and weâve got Dumbledore!â\n","\n","âI donât think weâve got him all the time,â said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. âHavenât you noticed? His seatâs been empty as often as Hagridâs this past week.â\n","\n","Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmasterâs chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.\n","\n","âI think heâs left the school to do something with the Order,â said Hermione in a low voice. âI mean . . . itâs all looking serious, isnât it?â\n","\n","Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.\n","\n","When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twinsâ parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harryâs nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.\n","\n","As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiryhaired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.\n","\n","âWe met on the train, in old Sluggyâs compartment,â he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harryâs hand. âCormac McLaggen, Keeper.â\n","\n","âYou didnât try out last year, did you?â asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.\n","\n","âI was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,â said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. âAte a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry. âWell. . . if you wait over there â¦â He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggenâs face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both âold Sluggyâsâ favorites. Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts.\n","\n","The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.\n","\n","The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.\n","\n","âIf thereâs anyone else here whoâs not from Gryffindor,â roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, âleave now, please!\n","\n","There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.\n","\n","After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.\n","\n","âThatâs my final decision and if you donât get out of the way of the Keepers Iâll hex you,â he bellowed.\n","\n","Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broadchested thirdyear boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harryâs head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.\n","\n","Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.\n","\n","None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harryâs great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.\n","\n","Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. âGood luck!â cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.\n","\n","Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggenâs red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.\n","\n","âHis sister didnât really try,â said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernonâs. âShe gave him an easy save.â\n","\n","âRubbish,â said Harry coldly. âThat was the one he nearly missed.â\n","\n","McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.\n","\n","âGive me another go.â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry. âYouâve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ronâs Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.â\n","\n","He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.\n","\n","Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.\n","\n","âWell done,â he croaked. âYou flew really well ââ\n","\n","âYou did brilliantly, Ron!â\n","\n","This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.\n","\n","After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagridâs. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagridâs.\n","\n","âI thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,â Ron was saying happily. âTricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it ââ\n","\n","âYes, yes, you were magnificent,â said Hermione, looking amused.\n","\n","âI was better than that McLaggen anyway,â said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. âDid you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like heâd been Confunded. â¦â\n","\n","To Harryâs surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.\n","\n","The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagridâs cabin. He clicked his razorsharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them.\n","\n","âOh dear,â said Hermione nervously. âHeâs still a bit scary, isnât he?â\n","\n","âCome off it, youâve ridden him, havenât you?â said Ron. Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.\n","\n","âHow are you?â Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. âMissing him? But youâre okay here with Hagrid, arenât you?â\n","\n","âOi!â said a loud voice.\n","\n","Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward.\n","\n","âGit away from him! Heâll have yer fingers â oh. Itâs yeh lot.â\n","\n","Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.\n","\n","âOh dear!â said Hermione, looking stricken.\n","\n","âDonât worry about it,â said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly. âHagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!â\n","\n","There was no sound from within.\n","\n","âIf you donât open the door, weâll blast it open!â Harry said, pulling out his wand.\n","\n","âHarry!â said Hermione, sounding shocked. âYou canât possibly ââ\n","\n","âYeah, I can!â said Harry. âStand back ââ\n","\n","But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.\n","\n","âIâm a teacher!â he roared at Harry. âA teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!â\n","\n","âIâm sorry, sirâ said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.\n","\n","Hagrid looked stunned. âSince when have yeh called me âsirâ?â\n","\n","âSince when have you called me âPotterâ?â\n","\n","âOh, very clever,â growled Hagrid. âVery amusinâ. Thatâs me outsmarted, innit? All righâ, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .â\n","\n","Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened.\n","\n","âWell?â said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harryâs knee and drooling all over his robes. âWhatâs this? Feelinâ sorry for me? Reckon Iâm lonely or summat?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry at once. âWe wanted to see you.â\n","\n","âWeâve missed you!â said Hermione tremulously.\n","\n","âMissed me, have yeh?â snorted Hagrid. âYeah. Righâ.â\n","\n","He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucketsized mugs of mahoganybrown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagridâs cooking, and took one at once.\n","\n","âHagrid,â said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, âwe really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.â Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner.\n","\n","âWe did!â said Hermione. âBut none of us could fit it into our schedules!â\n","\n","âYeah. Righâ,â said Hagrid again.\n","\n","There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like footlong maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.\n","\n","âWhat are they, Hagrid?â asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.\n","\n","âJusâ giant grubs,â said Hagrid.\n","\n","âAnd they grow into â¦ ?â said Ron, looking apprehensive.\n","\n","âThey wonâ grow inter nuthinâ,â said Hagrid. âI got âem ter feed ter Aragog.â\n","\n","And without warning, he burst into tears.\n","\n","âHagrid!â cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. âWhat is it?â\n","\n","âItâs. . . him . ..â gulped Hagrid, his beetleblack eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. âItâs . . . Aragog. â¦ I think heâs dyinâ. . , . He got ill over the summer anâ heâs not gettinâ betterâ¦. I donâ know what Iâll do if he â¦ if he â¦ Weâve bin tergether so long. â¦â\n","\n","Hermione patted Hagridâs shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a halfbrother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.\n","\n","âIs there â is there anything we can do?â Hermione asked, ignoring Ronâs frantic grimaces and headshakings.\n","\n","âI donâ think there is, Hermione,â choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. âSee, the rest oâ the tribe â¦ Aragogâs family . . . theyâre gettinâ a bit funny now heâs illâ¦ bit restive â¦â\n","\n","âYeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,â said Ron in an undertone.\n","\n","ââ¦ I donâ reckon itâd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the moâ,â Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. âBut thanks fer offerinâ, Hermione. â¦ It means a lot.â\n","\n","After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.\n","\n","âAr, I always knew yehâd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,â he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. âEven if yeh applied fer TimeTurners ââ\n","\n","âWe couldnât have done,â said Hermione. âWe smashed the entire stock of Ministry TimeTurners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet.â\n","\n","âAr, well then,â said Hagrid. âThereâs no way yeh couldâve done it. â¦ Iâm sorry Iâve bin â yeh know â Iâve jusâ bin worried about Aragog â¦ an I did wonder whether, if Professor GrubblyPlank had bin teachinâ yeh ââ\n","\n","At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor GrubblyPlank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.\n","\n","âIâm starving,â said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. âAnd Iâve got that detention with Snape tonight, I havenât got much time for dinner.â\n","\n","As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermioneâs arm and held her back.\n","\n","âWhat?â said Hermione defensively.\n","\n","âIf you ask me,â said Harry quietly, âMcLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.â\n","\n","Hermione blushed.\n","\n","âOh, all right then, I did it,â she whispered. âBut you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, heâs got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didnât get in â you wouldnât have wanted someone like that on the team.â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry. âNo, I suppose thatâs true. But wasnât that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, youâre a prefect, arenât you?â\n","\n","âOh, be quiet,â she snapped, as he smirked.\n","\n","âWhat are you two doing?â demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.\n","\n","âNothing,â said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harryâs stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.\n","\n","âHarry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!â he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, âI was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? Weâre having a little party, just a few rising stars, Iâve got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin â I donât know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries â and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.â\n","\n","Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him.\n","\n","âI canât come, Professor,â said Harry at once. âIâve got a detention with Professor Snape.â\n","\n","âOh dear!â said Slughorn, his face falling comically. âDear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, Iâll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. Iâm sure Iâll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, Iâll see you both later!â He bustled away out of the Hall.\n","\n","âHeâs got no chance of persuading Snape,â said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. âThis detentionâs already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he wonât do it for anyone else.â\n","\n","âOh, I wish you could come, I donât want to go on my own!â said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.\n","\n","âI doubt youâll be alone, Ginnyâll probably be invited,â snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.\n","\n","After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.\n","\n","âAnything new?â said Harry.\n","\n","âNot really. . .â Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. âOh, look, your dadâs in here, Ron â heâs all right!â she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. âIt just says heâs been to visit the Malfoysâ house. âThis second search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tipoff.ââ\n","\n","âYeah, mine!â said Harry. âI told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if itâs not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him ââ\n","\n","âBut how can he have done, Harry?â said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. âWe were all searched when we arrived, werenât we?â\n","\n","âWere you?â said Harry, taken aback. âI wasnât!â\n","\n","âOh no, of course you werenât, I forgot you were late. Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy canât have brought in anything dangerous!â\n","\n","Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection.\n","\n","âSomeoneâs sent it to him by owl, then,â he said. âHis mother or someone.â\n","\n","âAll the owls are being checked too,â said Hermione. âFilch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.â\n","\n","Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown.\n","\n","âCan you think of any way Malfoy â ?â\n","\n","âOh, drop it, Harry,â said Ron.\n","\n","âListen, itâs not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!â said Harry, firing up.\n","\n","âWell, as Iâm not invited to any parties,â said Ron, getting to his feet again, âI think Iâll go to bed.â\n","\n","He stomped off toward the door to the boysâ dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him.\n","\n","âHarry?â said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. âIâve got a message for you.â\n","\n","âFrom Professor Slughorn?â asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.\n","\n","âNo â¦ from Professor Snape,â said Demelza. Harryâs heart sank. âHe says youâre to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention â er â no matter how many party invitations youâve received. And he wanted you to know youâll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and â and he says thereâs no need to bring protective gloves.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry grimly. âThanks a lot, Demelza.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 12: Silver and opals\n","\n","\n","Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing?\n","\n","Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.\n","\n","Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.\n","\n","Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced PotionMaking. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the HalfBlood Princes copy of Advanced PotionMaking hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossingsout and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.\n","\n","Harry had already attempted a few of the Princeâs selfinvented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.\n","\n","Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossingsout and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:\n","\n","Levicorpus (nvbl)\n","\n","While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . that had to mean ânonverbal.â Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.\n","\n","Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. âAaaaaaaargh!â\n","\n","There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced PotionMaking flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.\n","\n","âSorry!â yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of Bed. âHang on â Iâll let you down ââ\n","\n","He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered the cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counterjinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.\n","\n","âSorry,â repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.\n","\n","âTomorrow,â said Ron in a muffled voice, âIâd rather you set the alarm clock.â\n","\n","By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys handknitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ronâs shock had subsided and he had decided that Harryâs new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.\n","\n","ââ¦ and then there was another flash, of light and I landed on the bed again!â Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.\n","\n","Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.\n","\n","âWas this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?â she asked.\n","\n","Harry frowned at her.\n","\n","âAlways jump to the worst conclusion, donât you?â\n","\n","âWas it?â\n","\n","âWell. . . yeah, it was, but so what?â\n","\n","âSo you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?â\n","\n","âWhy does it matter if itâs handwritten?â said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question.\n","\n","âBecause itâs probably not Ministry of Magic approved,â said Hermione. âAnd also,â she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, âbecause Iâm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.â\n","\n","Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.\n","\n","âIt was a laugh!â said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. âJust a laugh, Hermione, thatâs all!â\n","\n","âDangling people upside down by the ankle?â said Hermione. âWho puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?â\n","\n","âFred and George,â said Ron, shrugging, âitâs their kind of thing. And, erââ\n","\n","âMy dad,â said Harry. He had only just remembered.\n","\n","âWhat?â said Ron and Hermione together.\n","\n","âMy dad used this spell,â said Harry. âI â Lupin told me.â\n","\n","âThis last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the HalfBlood Prince possibly be â ?\n","\n","âMaybe your dad did use it, Harry,â said Hermione, âbut heâs not the only one. Weâve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case youâve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless.â\n","\n","Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.\n","\n","âThat was different,â he said robustly. âThey were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You donât like the Prince, Hermione,â he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, âbecause heâs better than you at Potions ââ\n","\n","âItâs got nothing to do with that!â said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. âI just think itâs very irresponsible to start performing spells when you donât even know what theyâre for, and stop talking about âthe Princeâ as if itâs his title, I bet itâs just a stupid nickname, and it doesnât seem as though he was a very nice person to me!â\n","\n","âI donât see where you get that from,â said Harry heatedly. âIf heâd been a budding Death Eater he wouldnât have been boasting about being âhalfblood,â would he?â\n","\n","Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pureblood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later.\n","\n","âThe Death Eaters canât all be pureblood, there arenât enough pureblood wizards left,â said Hermione stubbornly. âI expect most of them are halfbloods pretending to be pure. Itâs only Muggleborns they hate, theyâd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.â\n","\n","âThere is no way theyâd let me be a Death Eater!â said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. âMy whole family are blood traitors! Thatâs as bad as Muggleborns to Death Eaters!â\n","\n","âAnd theyâd love to have me,â said Harry sarcastically. âWeâd be best pals if they didnât keep trying to do me in.â\n","\n","This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.\n","\n","âHey, Harry, Iâm supposed to give you this.â\n","\n","It was a scroll of parchment with Harryâs name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.\n","\n","âThanks, Ginny. . . Itâs Dumbledoreâs next lesson!â Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. âMonday evening!â He felt suddenly light and happy. âWant to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?â he asked.\n","\n","âIâm going with Dean â might see you there,â she replied, waving at them as she left.\n","\n","Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triplechecking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.\n","\n","âWhat does it matter if weâre smuggling Dark stuff OUT?â demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. âSurely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?â\n","\n","His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.\n","\n","The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonkoâs Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.\n","\n","âThank God,â shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffeescented air. âLetâs stay here all afternoon.â\n","\n","âHarry, mâboy!â said a booming voice from behind them.\n","\n","âOh no,â muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.\n","\n","âHarry, thatâs three of my little suppers youâve missed now!â said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. âIt wonât do, mâboy, Iâm determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, donât you?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Hermione helplessly, âtheyâre really ââ\n","\n","âSo why donât you come along, Harry?â demanded Slughorn.\n","\n","âWell, Iâve had Quidditch practice, Professor,â said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbonadorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.\n","\n","âWell, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work!â said Slughorn. âBut a little recreation never hurt any body. Now, how about Monday night, you canât possibly want to practice in this weatherâ¦.â\n","\n","âI canât, Professor, Iâve got â er â an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.â\n","\n","âUnlucky again!â cried Slughorn dramatically. âAh, well . . . you canât evade me forever, Harry!â\n","\n","And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.\n","\n","âI canât believe youâve wriggled out of another one,â said Hermione, shaking her head. âTheyâre not that bad, you know. . . Theyâre even quite fun sometimes. . . .â But then she caught sight of Ronâs expression. âOh, look â theyâve got deluxe sugar quills â those would last hours!â\n","\n","Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new extralarge sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next.\n","\n","âLetâs go to the Three Broomsticks,â said Harry. âItâll be warm.â\n","\n","They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rainwashed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hogâs Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.\n","\n","âMundungus!â\n","\n","The squat, bandylegged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.\n","\n","âOh, âello, âArry,â said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. âWell, donât let me keep ya.â\n","\n","And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.\n","\n","âAre you selling this stuff?â asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubbylooking objects from the ground.\n","\n","âOh, well, gotta scrape a living,â said Mundungus. âGimme that!â\n","\n","Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.\n","\n","âHang on,â Ron said slowly. âThis looks familiar ââ\n","\n","âThank you!â said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ronâs hand and stuffing it back into the case. âWell, Iâll see you all _ OUCH!â\n","\n","Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.\n","\n","âHarry!â squealed Hermione.\n","\n","âYou took that from Sinusâs house,â said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. âThat had the Black family crest on it.â\n","\n","âI â no â what â ?â spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple.\n","\n","âWhat did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?â snarled Harry.\n","\n","âI â no â â\n","\n","âGive it to me!â\n","\n","âHarry, you mustnât!â shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue.\n","\n","There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungusâs throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then â CRACKâ he Disapparated.\n","\n","Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.\n","\n","âCOME BACK, YOU THIEVING â !â\n","\n","âThereâs no point, Harry.â Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.\n","\n","âMundungus will probably be in London by now. Thereâs no point yelling.â\n","\n","âHeâs nicked Siriusâs stuff! Nicked it!â\n","\n","âYes, but still,â said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. âYou should get out of the cold.â\n","\n","She watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks. The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, âHe was nicking Siriusâs stuff!â\n","\n","âI know, Harry, but please donât shout, people are staring,â whispered Hermione. âGo and sit down, Iâll get you a drink.â\n","\n","Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.\n","\n","âCanât the Order control Mundungus?â Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. âCanât they at least stop him stealing everything thatâs not fixed down when heâs at headquarters?â\n","\n","âShh!â said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. âHarry, Iâd be annoyed too, I know itâs your things heâs stealingââ\n","\n","Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\n","\n","âYeah, itâs my stuff!â he said. âNo wonder he wasnât pleased to see me! Well, Iâm going to tell Dumbledore whatâs going on, heâs the only one who scares Mundungus.â\n","\n","âGood idea,â whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. âRon, what are you staring at?â\n","\n","âNothing,â said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.\n","\n","âI expect ânothingâsâ in the back getting more firewhisky,â said Hermione waspishly.\n","\n","Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, âShall we call it a day and go back to school, then?â\n","\n","The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street. Harryâs thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifootâs Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.\n","\n","It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand. âItâs nothing to do with you, Leanne!â Harry heard Katie say.\n","\n","They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harryâs glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.\n","\n","At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.\n","\n","Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katieâs ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katieâs legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.\n","\n","Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.\n","\n","âStay there!â he shouted at the others over the howling wind. âIâm going for help!â\n","\n","He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.\n","\n","âHagrid!â he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen.\n","\n","âHarry!â said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. âJusâ bin visitinâ Grawp, heâs cominâ on so well yeh wouldnâ ââ\n","\n","âHagrid, someoneâs hurt back there, or cursed, or something ââ\n","\n","âWha ?â said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind.\n","\n","âSomeoneâs been cursed!â bellowed Harry.\n","\n","âCursed? Whoâs bin cursed â not Ron? Hermione?â\n","\n","âNo, itâs not them, itâs Katie Bell â this way . . .â\n","\n","Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.\n","\n","âGet back!â shouted Hagrid. âLemme see her!â\n","\n","âSomethingâs happened to her!â sobbed Leanne. âI donât know what ââ\n","\n","Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katieâs piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind.\n","\n","Hermione hurried over to Katieâs wailing friend and put an arm around her.\n","\n","âItâs Leanne, isnât it?â\n","\n","The girl nodded.\n","\n","âDid it just happen all of a sudden, or â ?â\n","\n","âIt was when that package tore,â sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brownpaper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back.\n","\n","âDonât touch it!â\n","\n","He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.\n","\n","âIâve seen that before,â said Harry, staring at the thing. âIt was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it.â He looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. âHow did Katie get hold of this?â\n","\n","âWell, thatâs why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it. â¦ Oh no, oh no, I bet sheâd been Imperiused and I didnât realize!â\n","\n","Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently.\n","\n","âShe didnât say whoâd given it to her, Leanne?â\n","\n","âNo . . . she wouldnât tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldnât listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and â and ââ\n","\n","Leanne let out a wail of despair.\n","\n","âWeâd better get up to school,â said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne. âWeâll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .â\n","\n","Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ronâs gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.\n","\n","âWeâll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,â he said.\n","\n","As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.\n","\n","âMalfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!â ,\n","\n","âI â I dunno, Harry,â said Ron hesitantly. âLoads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didnât that girl say Katie got it in the girlsâ bathroom?â\n","\n","âShe said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didnât necessarily get it in the bathroom itselfââ\n","\n","âMcGonagall!â said Ron warningly.\n","\n","Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.\n","\n","âHagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell â upstairs to my office at once, please! Whatâs that youâre holding, Potter?â\n","\n","âItâs the thing she touched,â said Harry.\n","\n","âGood lord,â said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. âNo, no, Filch, theyâre with me!â she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. âTake this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!â\n","\n","Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleetspattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne.\n","\n","âWell?â she said sharply. âWhat happened?â\n","\n","Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word out of her.\n","\n","âAll right,â said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, âgo up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.â\n","\n","When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n","\n","âWhat happened when Katie touched the necklace?â\n","\n","âShe rose up in the air,â said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, âand then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?â\n","\n","âThe headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,â said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised.\n","\n","âAway?â Harry repeated angrily.\n","\n","âYes, Potter, away!â said Professor McGonagall tartly. âBut anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, Iâm sure!â\n","\n","For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a lifeanddeath matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at.\n","\n","âI think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.â\n","\n","On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.\n","\n","âThat is a very serious accusation, Potter,â said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. âDo you have any proof?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry, âbutâ¦â and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin.\n","\n","When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.\n","\n","âMalfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?â\n","\n","âNo, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didnât have it with him. But thatâs not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace ââ\n","\n","âYou saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?â\n","\n","âNo, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him ââ\n","\n","âBut Harry,â Hermione interrupted, âBorgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no ââ\n","\n","âBecause he didnât want to touch it, obviously!â said Harry angrily.\n","\n","âWhat he actually said was, âHow would I look carrying that down the street?ââ said Hermione.\n","\n","âWell, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,â interjected Ron.\n","\n","âOh, Ron,â said Hermione despairingly, âit would be all wrapped up, so he wouldnât have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street â and in any case,â she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, âI asked Borgin about the necklace, donât you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didnât say it was already sold or anything ââ\n","\n","âWell, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasnât going to tell you â anyway, Malfoy couldâve sent off for it since ââ\n","\n","âThatâs enough!â said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. âPotter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people ââ\n","\n","ââ thatâs what I said ââ muttered Ron.\n","\n","ââ and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge ââ\n","\n","âBut ââ\n","\n","ââ and what is more,â said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, âMr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.â\n","\n","Harry gaped at her, deflating.\n","\n","âHow do you know, Professor?â\n","\n","âBecause he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,â she said as she marched past them, âbut I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.â\n","\n","She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.\n","\n","Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.\n","\n","âSo who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?â asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.\n","\n","âGoodness only knows,â said Hermione. âBut whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.â\n","\n","âIt couldâve been meant for loads of people,â said Harry. âDumbledore â the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn â Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they canât be pleased that heâs sided with Dumbledore. Or ââ\n","\n","âOr you,â said Hermione, looking troubled.\n","\n","âCouldnât have been,â said Harry, âor Katie wouldâve just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldnât she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?â\n","\n","âHarry, Malfoy wasnât in Hogsmeade!â said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration.\n","\n","âHe must have used an accomplice, then,â said Harry. âCrabbe or Goyle â or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, heâll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now heâs joined up ââ\n","\n","Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said Thereâs no point arguing with him.\n","\n","âDilligrout,â said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.\n","\n","The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katieâs fate had not yet spread.\n","\n","âIt wasnât a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,â said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. âThe curse didnât even make it into the castle. Not what youâd call foolproof.â\n","\n","âYouâre right,â said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. âIt wasnât very well thoughtout at all.â\n","\n","âBut since when has Malfoy been one of the worldâs great thinkers?â asked Harry.\n","\n","Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 13: The Secret Riddle\n","\n","\n","Katie was removed to St. Mungoâs Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.\n","\n","âOh, and Malfoy knows, of course,â said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his MalfoyIsaDeathEater theory.\n","\n","Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday nightâs lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledoreâs office at eight oâclock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.\n","\n","âYou have had a busy time while I have been away,â Dumbledore said. âI believe you witnessed Katieâs accident.â\n","\n","âYes, sir. How is she?â\n","\n","âStill very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin; there was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse ââ\n","\n","âWhy him?â asked Harry quickly. âWhy not Madam Pomfrey?â\n","\n","âImpertinent,â said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Siriusâs greatgreatgrandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. âI would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.â\n","\n","âYes, thank you, Phineas,â said Dumbledore quellingly. âProfessor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungoâs staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.â\n","\n","âWhere were you this weekend, sir?â Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.\n","\n","âI would rather not say just now,â said Dumbledore. âHowever, I shall tell you in due course.â\n","\n","âYou will?â said Harry, startled.\n","\n","âYes, I expect so,â said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.\n","\n","âSir,â said Harry tentatively, âI met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.â\n","\n","âAh yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with lightfingered contempt,â said Dumbledore, frowning a little. âHe has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Siriusâs old possessions.â\n","\n","âThat mangy old halfblood has been stealing Black heirlooms?â said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\n","\n","âProfessor,â said Harry, after a short pause, âdid Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?â\n","\n","âShe told me of your suspicions, yes,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âAnd do you â ?â\n","\n","âI shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katieâs accident,â said Dumbledore. âBut what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.â\n","\n","Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his longfingered hands.\n","\n","âYou will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemortâs beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort.â\n","\n","âHow do you know she was in London, sir?â\n","\n","âBecause of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,â said Dumbledore, âwho, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.â\n","\n","He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes.\n","\n","âYes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherinâs. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, âOh, this was Merlinâs, this was, his favorite teapot,â but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didnât seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!â\n","\n","Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extravigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come.\n","\n","âHe only gave her ten Galleons?â said Harry indignantly.\n","\n","âCaractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,â said Dumbledore. âSo we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvoloâs treasured family heirlooms.â\n","\n","âBut she could do magic!â said Harry impatiently. âShe could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldnât she?â\n","\n","âAh,â said Dumbledore, âperhaps she could. But it is my beliefâI am guessing again, but I am sure I am right â that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.â\n","\n","âShe wouldnât even stay alive for her son?â\n","\n","Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. âCould you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry quickly, âbut she had a choice, didnât she, not like my mother ââ\n","\n","âYour mother had a choice too,â said Dumbledore gently. âYes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your motherâs courage. And now, if you will stand â¦â\n","\n","âWhere are we going?â Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk.\n","\n","âThis time,â said Dumbledore, âwe are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry â¦â\n","\n","Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, oldfashioned London street.\n","\n","âThere I am,â said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horsedrawn milk cart.\n","\n","This younger Albus Dumbledoreâs long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.\n","\n","âNice suit, sir,â said Harry, before he could stop himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.\n","\n","âGood afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?â\n","\n","âOh,â said the bewilderedlooking girl, taking in Dumbledoreâs eccentric appearance. âUm. . . just a moâ . . . MRS. COLE!â she bellowed over her shoulder.\n","\n","Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. âCome in, sheâs on âer way.â\n","\n","Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassedlooking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharpfeatured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.\n","\n","â. . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalleyâs oozing all over his sheets â chicken pox on top of everything else,â she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold.\n","\n","âGood afternoon,â said Dumbledore, holding out his hand. Mrs. Cole simply gaped.\n","\n","âMy name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.â\n","\n","Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, âOh yes. Well â well then â youâd better come into my room. Yes.â\n","\n","She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.\n","\n","âI am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âAre you family?â asked Mrs. Cole.\n","\n","âNo, I am a teacher,â said Dumbledore. âI have come to offer Tom a place at my school.â\n","\n","âWhat schoolâs this, then?â\n","\n","âIt is called Hogwarts,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âAnd how come youâre interested in Tom?â\n","\n","âWe believe he has qualities we are looking for.â\n","\n","âYou mean heâs won a scholarship? How can he have done? Heâs never been entered for one.â\n","\n","âWell, his name has been down for our school since birth ââ\n","\n","âWho registered him? His parents?â\n","\n","There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Coleâs desktop.\n","\n","âHere,â said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, âI think this will make everything clear.â\n","\n","Mrs. Coleâs eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.\n","\n","âThat seems perfectly in order,â she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.\n","\n","âEr â may I offer you a glass of gin?â she said in an extrarefined voice.\n","\n","âThank you very much,â said Dumbledore, beaming.\n","\n","It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didnât hesitate to press his advantage.\n","\n","âI was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddleâs history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?â\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. âI remember it clear as anything, because Iâd just started here myself. New Yearâs Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasnât the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.â\n","\n","Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.\n","\n","âDid she say anything before she died?â asked Dumbledore. âAnything about the boyâs father, for instance?â\n","\n","âNow, as it happens, she did,â said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. âI remember she said to me, âI hope he looks like his papa,â and I wonât lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty â and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father â yes, I know, funny name, isnât it? We wondered whether she came from a circus â and she said the boyâs surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word.\n","\n","âWell, we named him just as sheâd said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and heâs been here ever since.â\n","\n","Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, âHeâs a funny boy.â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore. âI thought he might be.â\n","\n","âHe was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was. . . odd.â\n","\n","âOdd in what way?â asked Dumbledore gently.\n","\n","âWell, he ââ\n","\n","But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass.\n","\n","âHeâs definitely got a place at your school, you say?â\n","\n","âDefinitely,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âAnd nothing I say can change that?â\n","\n","âNothing,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âYouâll be taking him away, whatever?â\n","\n","âWhatever,â repeated Dumbledore gravely.\n","\n","She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, âHe scares the other children.â\n","\n","âYou mean he is a bully?â asked Dumbledore.\n","\n","âI think he must be,â said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, âbut itâs very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things â¦â\n","\n","Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.\n","\n","âBilly Stubbsâs rabbit. . . well, Tom said he didnât do it and I donât see how he could have done, but even so, it didnât hang itself from the rafters, did it?â\n","\n","âI shouldnât think so, no,â said Dumbledore quietly.\n","\n","âBut Iâm jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And thenâ â Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time â âon the summer outing â we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside â well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that theyâd gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore theyâd just gone exploring, but something happened in there, Iâm sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . .â\n","\n","She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. âI donât think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.â\n","\n","âYou understand, Iâm sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?â said Dumbledore. âHe will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.â\n","\n","âOh, well, thatâs better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,â said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though twothirds of the gin was now gone. âI suppose youâd like to see him?â\n","\n","âVery much,â said Dumbledore, rising too.\n","\n","She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They looked reasonably wellcared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.\n","\n","âHere we are,â said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered.\n","\n","âTom? Youâve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton â sorry, Dunderbore. Heâs come to tell you â well, Iâll let him do it.â\n","\n","Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a book.\n","\n","There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddleâs face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, darkhaired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledoreâs eccentric appearance. There was a momentâs silence.\n","\n","âHow do you do, Tom?â said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand.\n","\n","The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.\n","\n","âI am Professor Dumbledore.â\n","\n","ââProfessorâ?â repeated Riddle. He looked wary. âIs that like âdoctorâ? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?â\n","\n","He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.\n","\n","âNo, no,â said Dumbledore, smiling.\n","\n","âI donât believe you,â said Riddle. âShe wants me looked at, doesnât she? Tell the truth!â\n","\n","He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.\n","\n","âWho are you?â\n","\n","âI have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school â your new school, if you would like to come.â\n","\n","Riddleâs reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.\n","\n","âYou canât kid me! The asylum, thatâs where youâre from, isnât it? âProfessor,â yes, of course â well, Iâm not going, see? That old catâs the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, theyâll tell you!\n","\n","âI am not from the asylum,â said Dumbledore patiently. âI am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you ââ\n","\n","âIâd like to see them try,â sneered Riddle.\n","\n","âHogwarts,â Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddleâs last words, âis a school for people with special abilities ââ\n","\n","âIâm not mad!â\n","\n","âI know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic.â\n","\n","There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledoreâs, as though trying to catch one of them lying.\n","\n","âMagic?â he repeated in a whisper.\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âItâs. . . itâs magic, what I can do?â\n","\n","âWhat is it that you can do?â\n","\n","âAll sorts,â breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. âI can make filings move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.â\n","\n","His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.\n","\n","âI knew I was different,â he whispered to his own quivering fingers. âI knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.â\n","\n","âWell, you were quite right,â said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. âYou are a wizard.â\n","\n","Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.\n","\n","âAre you a wizard too?â\n","\n","âYes, I am.â\n","\n","âProve it,â said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, âTell the truth.â\n","\n","Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. âIf, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwartsââ\n","\n","âOf course I am!â\n","\n","âThen you will address me as âProfessorâ or âsir.ââ\n","\n","Riddleâs expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, âIâm sorry, sir. I meant â please, Professor, could you show me â ?â\n","\n","Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.\n","\n","The wardrobe burst into flames.\n","\n","Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.\n","\n","Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. âWhere can I get one of them?â\n","\n","âAll in good time,â said Dumbledore. âI think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.â\n","\n","And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.\n","\n","âOpen the door,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.\n","\n","âTake it out,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.\n","\n","âIs there anything in that box that you ought not to have?â asked Dumbledore.\n","\n","Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. âYes, I suppose so, sir,â he said finally, in an expressionless voice.\n","\n","âOpen it,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yoyo, a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.\n","\n","âYou will return them to their owners with your apologies,â said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. âI shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts.â\n","\n","Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, âYes, sir.â\n","\n","âAt Hogwarts,â Dumbledore went on, âwe teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have â inadvertently, I am sure â been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic â yes, there is a Ministry â will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.â\n","\n","âYes, sir,â said Riddle again.\n","\n","It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, âI havenât got any money.â\n","\n","âThat is easily remedied,â said Dumbledore, drawing a leather moneypouch from his pocket. âThere is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but ââ\n","\n","âWhere do you buy spellbooks?â interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon,\n","\n","âIn Diagon Alley,â said Dumbledore. âI have your list of books and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything ââ\n","\n","âYouâre coming with me?â asked Riddle, looking up.\n","\n","âCertainly, if you ââ\n","\n","âI donât need you,â said Riddle. âIâm used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley â sir?â he added, catching Dumbledoreâs eye.\n","\n","Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, âYou will be able to see it, although Muggles around you â nonmagical people, that is â will not. Ask for Tom the barman â easy enough to remember, as he shares your name ââ\n","\n","Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.\n","\n","âYou dislike the name âTomâ?â\n","\n","âThere are a lot of Toms,â muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, âWas my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, theyâve told me.â\n","\n","âIâm afraid I donât know,â said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.\n","\n","âMy mother canât have been magic, or she wouldnât have died,â said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. âIt mustâve been him. So â when Iâve got all my stuffâ when do I come to this Hogwarts?â\n","\n","âAll the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,â said Dumbledore. âYou will leave from Kingâs Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.â\n","\n","Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, âI can speak to snakes. I found out when weâve been to the country on trips â they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?â\n","\n","Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress.\n","\n","âIt is unusual,â said Dumbledore, after a momentâs hesitation, âbut not unheard of.â\n","\n","His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddleâs face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.\n","\n","âGoodbye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.â\n","\n","âI think that will do,â said the whitehaired Dumbledore at Harryâs side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the presentday office.\n","\n","âSit down,â said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.\n","\n","Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.\n","\n","âHe believed it much quicker than I did â I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,â said Harry. âI didnât believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.â\n","\n","âYes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was â to use his word â âspecial,ââ said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âDid you know â then?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âDid I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?â said Dumbledore. âNo, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for othersâ sake as much as his.\n","\n","âHis powers, as you heard, were surprisingly welldeveloped for such a young wizard and â most interestingly and ominously of all â he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . . âI can make them hurt if I want to. . . .ââ\n","\n","âAnd he was a Parselmouth,â interjected Harry.\n","\n","âYes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.\n","\n","âTime is making fools of us again,â said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. âBut before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.\n","\n","âFirstly, I hope you noticed Riddleâs reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, âTomâ?â\n","\n","Harry nodded.\n","\n","âThere he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of âLord Voldemortâ behind which he has been hidden for so long.\n","\n","âI trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly selfsufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.\n","\n","âAnd lastly â I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry â the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpielike tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.\n","\n","âAnd now, it really is time for bed.â\n","\n","Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell I upon the little table on which Marvolo Gauntâs ring had rested last I time, but the ring was no longer there.\n","\n","âYes, Harry?â said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.\n","\n","âThe ringâs gone,â said Harry, looking around. âBut I thought I you might have the mouth organ or something.â\n","\n","Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his halfw moon spectacles.\n","\n","âVery astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.â\n","\n","And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself to be dismissed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 14: Felix Felicis\n","\n","\n","Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekendâs brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.\n","\n","âWow, scary thought, the boy YouKnowWho,â said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. âBut I still donât get why Dumbledoreâs showing you all this. I mean, itâs really interesting and everything, but whatâs the point?â\n","\n","âDunno,â said Harry, inserting a gum shield. âBut he says its all important and itâll help me survive.â\n","\n","âI think itâs fascinating,â said Hermione earnestly. âIt makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?â\n","\n","âSo how was Slughornâs latest party?â Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield.\n","\n","âOh, it was quite fun, really,â said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. âI mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because heâs so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.â\n","\n","âGwenog Jones?â said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. âThe Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?â\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Hermione. âPersonally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but ââ\n","\n","âQuite enough chat over here!â said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. âYouâre lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Nevilleâs already got his first pod!â\n","\n","They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.\n","\n","âOkay, Professor, weâre starting now!â said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, âshould ve used Muffliato, Harry.â\n","\n","âNo, we shouldnât!â said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the HalfBlood Prince and his spells. âWell, come on â¦ weâd better get going. â¦â\n","\n","She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.\n","\n","It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermioneâs hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Nevilleâs. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.\n","\n","âYou know, I donât think Iâll be having any of these in my garden when Iâve got my own place,â said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.\n","\n","âPass me a bowl,â said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at armâs length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.\n","\n","âDonât be squeamish, squeeze it out, theyâre best when theyâre fresh!â called Professor Sprout.\n","\n","âAnyway,â said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, âSlughornâs going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and thereâs no way youâll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.â\n","\n","Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, âAnd this is another party just for Slughornâs favorites, is it?â\n","\n","âJust for the Slug Club, yes,â said Hermione.\n","\n","The pod flew out from under Ronâs fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sproutâs head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, âLook, I didnât make up the name âSlug Clubâ ââ\n","\n","ââSlug Club,âârepeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. âItâs pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why donât you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug ââ\n","\n","âWeâre allowed to bring guests,â said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, âand I was going to ask you to come, but if you think itâs that stupid then I wonât bother!â\n","\n","Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.\n","\n","âYou were going to ask me?â asked Ron, in a completely different voice.\n","\n","âYes,â said Hermione angrily. âBut obviously if youâd rather 1 hooked up with McLaggen â¦â\n","\n","There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.\n","\n","âNo, I wouldnât,â said Ron, in a very quiet voice.\n","\n","Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.\n","\n","ââReparo,ââ he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harryâs presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of âFleshEating Trees of the Worldâ to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.\n","\n","âHand that over, Harry,â said Hermione hurriedly. âIt says weâre supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .â\n","\n","Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it. â¦ He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didnât split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\n","\n","âGotcha!â yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.\n","\n","The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughornâs party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what\n","\n","happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughornâs dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.\n","\n","Katie Bell was still in St. Mungoâs Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.\n","\n","Harry did not think he could stand another fullHouse tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermioneâs creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.\n","\n","âAre you still interested in playing Chaser?â\n","\n","âWha â ? Yeah, of course!â said Dean excitedly. Over Deanâs shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnegan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.\n","\n","âWell then, youâre in,â said Harry. âThereâs a practice tonight, seven oâclock.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Dean. âCheers, Harry! Blimey, I canât wait to tell Ginny!â\n","\n","He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamusâs head as one of Hermioneâs canaries whizzed over them.\n","\n","Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katieâs substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost. . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. . . .\n","\n","Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.\n","\n","Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.\n","\n","âIt was an accident, Iâm sorry, Demelza, really sorry!â Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. âI just ââ\n","\n","âPanicked,â Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. âYou prat, Ron, look at the state of her!â\n","\n","âI can fix that,â said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth, and saying âEpiskey.â âAnd Ginny, donât call Ron a prat, youâre not the Captain of this team ââ\n","\n","âWell, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should ââ\n","\n","Harry forced himself not to laugh.\n","\n","âIn the air, everyone, letâs go. . . .â\n","\n","Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.\n","\n","âGood work, everyone, I think weâll flatten Slytherin,â he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.\n","\n","âI played like a sack of dragon dung,â said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.\n","\n","âNo, you didnât,â said Harry firmly. âYouâre the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.â\n","\n","He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.\n","\n","It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harryâs stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ronâs voice as though from a great distance away.\n","\n","âOi!â\n","\n","Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around. âWhat?â said Ginny.\n","\n","âI donât want to find my own sister snogging people in public!â âThis was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!â said Ginny.\n","\n","Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Deanâs instant dismissal from the team.\n","\n","âEr . . . câmon, Ginny,â said Dean, âletâs go back to the common room. â¦â\n","\n","âYou go!â said Ginny. âI want a word with my dear brother!â Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene.\n","\n","âRight,â said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, âletâs get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron ââ âYeah, it is!â said Ron, just as angrily. âDâ you think I want people saying my sisterâs a ââ\n","\n","âA what?â shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. âA what, exactly?â âHe doesnât mean anything, Ginny ââ said Harry automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ronâs words. âOh yes he does!â she said, flaring up at Harry. âJust because heâs never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss heâs ever had is from our Auntie Muriel ââ\n","\n","âShut your mouth!â bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.\n","\n","âNo, I will not!â yelled Ginny, beside herself. âIâve seen you with Phlegm, hoping sheâll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, itâs pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self, you wouldnât mind so much that everyone else does it!â\n","\n","Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.\n","\n","âYou donât know what youâre talking about!â Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. âJust because I donât do it in public â !â\n","\n","Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.\n","\n","âBeen kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?â You â\n","\n","A streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.\n","\n","âDonât be stupid ââ\n","\n","âHarryâs snogged Cho Chang!â shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. âAnd Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, itâs only you who acts like itâs something disgusting, Ron, and thatâs because youâve got about as much experience as a twelveyearold!â\n","\n","And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Richâs cat, appeared around the corner, which broke the tension.\n","\n","âCâmon,â said Harry, as the sound of Filchâs shuffling feet reached their ears.\n","\n","They hurried up the stairs and along a seventhfloor corridor. âOi, out of the way!â Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.\n","\n","Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. Itâs just because sheâs Ronâs sister, he told himself. You just didnât like seeing her kissing Dean because sheâs Ronâs sister. . . .\n","\n","But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The monster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like âbetrayal of trustâ . . . âsupposed to be my friendâ . . .\n","\n","âDâyou think Hermione did snog Krum?â Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone â âWhat?â he said confusedly. âOh â¦ er â¦â The honest answer was âyes,â but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harryâs face.\n","\n","âDilligrout,â he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room.\n","\n","Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts,\n","\n","Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his fourposter and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elderbrotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now. â¦ It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing herâ¦ No â¦ he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .\n","\n","Ron gave a great grunting snore.\n","\n","Sheâs Ronâs sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ronâs sister. Sheâs outofbounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.\n","\n","Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beaterâs bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only coldshouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average BlastEnded Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boysâ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.\n","\n","To Harryâs dismay, Ronâs new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.\n","\n","âYou shut up and leave her alone!â shouted Peakes, who was about twothirds Ronâs height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.\n","\n","âENOUGH!â bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ronâs direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the BatBogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. âPeakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today, Ron . . .â he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, âyouâre my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and Iâm going to kick you off the team.â\n","\n","He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom. all the fight went out of him and he said, âI resign. Iâm pathetic.â\n","\n","âYouâre not pathetic and youâre not resigning!â said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. âYou can save anything when youâre on form, itâs a mental problem youâve got!â âYou calling me mental?â âYeah, maybe I am!â\n","\n","They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. âI know you havenât got any time to find another Keeper, so Iâll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, Iâm taking myself off the team.â\n","\n","Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ronâs confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goalsaving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.\n","\n","Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . . .\n","\n","If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .\n","\n","And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.\n","\n","Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.\n","\n","The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.\n","\n","âCheer up, Ron!â called Lavender. âI know youâll be brilliant!â : Ron ignored her.\n","\n","âTea?â Harry asked him. âCoffee? Pumpkin juice?â âAnything,â said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.\n","\n","A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ronâs recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.\n","\n","âHow are you both feeling?â she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ronâs head.\n","\n","âFine,â said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. âThere you go, Ron. Drink up.â\n","\n","Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke\n","\n","sharply.\n","\n","âDonât drink that, Ron!â\n","\n","Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.\n","\n","âWhy not?â said Ron.\n","\n","Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.\n","\n","âYou just put something in that drink.â\n","\n","âExcuse me?â said Harry.\n","\n","âYou heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ronâs drink. Youâve got the bottle in your hand right now!â\n","\n","âI dont know what youâre talking about,â said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.\n","\n","âRon, I warn you, donât drink it!â Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, âStop bossing me around, Hermione.â\n","\n","She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, âYou should be expelled for that. Iâd never have believed it of you, Harry!â\n","\n","âLook whoâs talking,â he whispered back. âConfunded anyone lately?â\n","\n","She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his lips.\n","\n","âNearly time/â said Harry blithely.\n","\n","The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.\n","\n","âPretty lucky the weathers this good, eh?â Harry asked Ron.\n","\n","âYeah,â said Ron, who was pale and sicklooking.\n","\n","Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.\n","\n","âConditions look ideal,â said Ginny, ignoring Ron. âAnd guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey â he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and heâs too sore to play! And even better than that â Malfoyâs gone off sick too!â\n","\n","âWhat?â said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. âHeâs ill? Whatâs wrong with him?â\n","\n","âNo idea, but itâs great for us,â said Ginny brightly. âTheyâre playing Harper instead; heâs in my year and heâs an idiot.â\n","\n","Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?\n","\n","âFishy, isnât it?â he said in an undertone to Ron. âMalfoy not playing?â\n","\n","âLucky, I call it,â said Ron, looking slightly more animated. âAnd Vaisey off too, heâs their best goal scorer, I didnât fancy â hey!â he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry.\n","\n","âWhat?â\n","\n","âIâ¦ you . . .â Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. âMy drink â¦ my pumpkin juice â¦ you didnâtâ¦?â\n","\n","Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, âWeâll be starting in about five minutes, youâd better get your boots on.â\n","\n","They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegoodâs famous liontopped hat.\n","\n","Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.\n","\n","âCaptains shake hands,â she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. âMount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .â\n","\n","The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.\n","\n","Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentatorâs started up.\n","\n","âWell, there they go, and I think weâre all surprised to see the team that Potterâs put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasleyâs patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . .â\n","\n","These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentatorâs podium. A call, skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordanâs; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\n","\n","âOh, and here comes Slytherinâs first attempt on goal, itâs Urquhart streaking down the pitch and ââ\n","\n","Harrys stomach turned over.\n","\n","ââ Weasley saves it, well, heâs bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . .â\n","\n","âThatâs right, Smith, he is,â muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.\n","\n","With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindorâs six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.\n","\n","âOf course, Coote isnât really the usual build for a Beater,â said Zacharias loftily, âtheyâve generally got a bit more muscle ââ\n","\n","âHit a Bludger at him!â Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.\n","\n","It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a\n","\n","rousing chorus of the old favorite âWeasley Is Our King,â he pretended to conduct them from on high.\n","\n","âThinks heâs something special today, doesnât he?â said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. âYour bloodtraitor palâ¦â Madam Hoochâs back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. â¦\n","\n","âAnd I think Harper of Slytherinâs seen the Snitch!â said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. âYes, heâs certainly seen something Potter hasnât!â\n","\n","Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadnât he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky â Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.\n","\n","Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smithâs commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost. . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. â¦\n","\n","âOi, Harper!â yelled Harry in desperation. âHow much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?â\n","\n","He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a doubletake; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.\n","\n","âYES!â Hairy yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.\n","\n","âGinny, whereâre you going?â yelled Harry, who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of tin1 team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentators podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring,: Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, âForgot to brake, Professor, sorry.â\n","\n","Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air ami waving to their supporters.\n","\n","The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant. âParty up in the common room, Seamus said!â yelled Dean exuberantly. âCâmon, Ginny, Demelza!â\n","\n","Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined. âI want a word with you, Harry.â She took a deep breath. âYon shouldnât have done it. You heard Slughorn, its illegal.â âWhat are you going to do, turn us in?â demanded Ron. âWhat are you two talking about?â asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning, âYou know perfectly well what weâre talking about!â said Hermione shrilly. âYou spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Iâelix Felicis!â\n","\n","âNo, I didnât,â said Harry, turning back to face them both.\n","\n","âYes you did, Harry, and thatâs why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!â\n","\n","âI didnât put it in!â said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. âI wanted Ron to think Iâd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.â He looked at Ron. âYou saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.â\n","\n","He pocketed the potion again.\n","\n","âThere really wasnât anything in my pumpkin juice?â Ron said, astounded. âBut the weatherâs good. . . and Vaisey couldnât play. â¦ I honestly havenât been given lucky potion?â ]\n","\n","Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. âYou added Felix Felicis to Ronâs juice this morning, thatâs why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!â\n","\n","âI never said you couldnât â Ron, you thought youâd been given it too!â\n","\n","But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.\n","\n","âEr,â said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, âshall. . . shall we go up to the party, then?â\n","\n","âYou go!â said Hermione, blinking back tears. âIâm sick of Ron at the moment, I donât know what Iâm supposed to have done. . . .â\n","\n","And she stormed out of the changing room too.\n","\n","Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.\n","\n","Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blowbyblow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughornâs Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\n","\n","âLooking for Ron?â she asked, smirking. âHeâs over there, the filthy hypocrite.â\n","\n","Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.\n","\n","âIt looks like heâs eating her face, doesnât it?â said Ginny dispassionately. âBut I suppose heâs got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.â\n","\n","She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.\n","\n","Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.\n","\n","He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside , seemed to be deserted.\n","\n","âHermione?â\n","\n","He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacherâs desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.\n","\n","âOh, hello, Harry,â she said in a brittle voice. âI was just practicing.â\n","\n","âYeah . . . theyâre â er â really good. â¦â said Harry.\n","\n","He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally highpitched voice, âRon seems to be enjoying the celebrations.â\n","\n","âEr . . . does he?â said Harry.\n","\n","âDonât pretend you didnât see him,â said Hermione. âHe wasnât exactly hiding it, was â ?â\n","\n","The door behind them burst open. To Harryâs horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand. ; â\n","\n","âOh,â he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.\n","\n","âOops!â said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.\n","\n","There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, âHi, Harry! Wondered where youâd got to!â\n","\n","Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.\n","\n","âYou shouldnât leave Lavender waiting outside,â she said quietly. âSheâll wonder where youâve gone.â\n","\n","She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.\n","\n","âOppugno!â came a shriek from the doorway.\n","\n","Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\n","\n","âGerremoffme!â he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 15: The Unbreakable Vow\n","\n","\n","Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve C hristmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunat e ly, however, Harryâs frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castleâs secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to naviga t e mistletoefree routes between classes.\n","\n","Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.\n","\n","Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermioneâs bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.\n","\n","âShe canât complain,â he told Harry. âShe snogged Krum. So sheâs found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, itâs a free country. I havenât done anything wrong.â\n","\n","Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Q uest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.\n","\n","âI never promised Hermione anything , â Ron mumbled. âI mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughornâs Christmas party with her, but she never saidâ¦ just as friendsâ¦ Iâm a free agentâ¦â\n","\n","Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ronâs voice trailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words âKrumâ and âCanât complainâ again.\n","\n","Hermioneâs schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.\n","\n","âHeâs at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,â said Hermione, while the librarian , Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. âI really couldnât care less.â\n","\n","She raised her quill and dotted an âiâ so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced PotionMaking and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the p rinceâs useful additions to Libatius B orageâs text.\n","\n","âAnd incidentally,â said Hermione, after a few moments, âyou need to be careful.â\n","\n","âFor the last time,â said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after threequarters of an ho u r of silence, âI am not giving back this book . Iâve learned more from the Halfblood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me inââ\n","\n","âIâm not talking about your stupid socalled prince,â said Hermione , giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. âIâm talki ng about earlier. I went into the girlâs bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. Theyâre all hoping theyâre going to get you to take them to Slughornâs party, and thay all seem to have bought Fred and Georgeâs love potions, which Iâm afraid to say probably work ââ\n","\n","âWhy didnât you confiscate them then?â demanded Harry, it seemed extraordinary that Hermioneâs m ania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.\n","\n","âThey didnât have the potions with them in the bathroom,â said Hermione scornfully, âThey were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Halfblood princeâ she gave the book another scornful look âcould dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, Iâd just invite someone to go with you, thatâll stop all the others thinking theyâve still got a chance. Itâs tomor r ow night, theyâre getting desperate.â\n","\n","âThere isnât anyone I want to invite,â mumbled Harry, who was still not trying to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\n","\n","âWell, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business.â said Hermione grimly.\n","\n","She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithma n cy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry wa t che d her with his mind a long way away.\n","\n","âHang on a moment,â he said slowly. âI thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleyâs Wizard Wheezes?â\n","\n","âAnd when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?â asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.\n","\n","âBut I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school?â\n","\n","âFred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,â said Hermione. âItâs part of their Owl order service.â\n","\n","âYou know a lot about it.â\n","\n","Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced PotionMaking.\n","\n","âIt was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,â she said coldly, âI donât go around putting potions in peopleâs drinksâ¦ or pretending too eit h er, which is just as badâ¦â\n","\n","âYeah, well, never mind that,â said Harry quickly. âThe point is, Filch is being fooled isnât he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldnât Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school â?â\n","\n","âOh, Harryâ¦ not that againâ¦â\n","\n","âCome on, why not?â demanded Harry.\n","\n","âLook , â sighed Hermione, âSecrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, donât they? Theyâre used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts. Theyâd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace, withi n seconds. But something thatâs just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn â t register â anyway Love potions arenât d ark or dangerous -â\n","\n","âEasy for you to say,â muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.\n","\n","ââ so it would be down to Filch to realise it wasnât a cough potion, and heâs not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from ââ\n","\n","Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.\n","\n","âThe library is now closed,â she said, âMind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct â what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?â\n","\n","âIt isnât the libraryâs, itâs mine!â said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced PotionMaking off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.\n","\n","â Spoiled!â she hissed . âDesecrated, befouled !â\n","\n","âItâs just a book thatâs been written on!â said Harry, tugging it out of her grip.\n","\n","She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away.\n","\n","âSheâll ban you from the library if youâre not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?â\n","\n","âItâs not my fault sheâs barking mad, Hermione. Or dâyou think she overheard you being rude about Filch? Iâve always thought there might be something between themâ¦â\n","\n","âOh, ha ha..â\n","\n","Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted lamplit corridors back to the common room, arguing w hether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.\n","\n","âBaublesâ said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password.\n","\n","âSame to you,â said the fat lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.\n","\n","âHi, Harry!â said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. âFancy a gillywater?â\n","\n","Hermione gave him a âwhatdidItellyou?â look over her shoulder.\n","\n","âNo thanks,â said Harry quickly. âI donât like it much.â\n","\n","âWell, take these anyway,â said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. âChocolate Cauldrons, theyâve got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I donât like them.â\n","\n","âOhâ right â thanks a lot.â said Harry, who could not think what else to say. â Erâ I â m just going over here with â¦â\n","\n","He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.\n","\n","âTold you,â said Hermione succinctly, â Sooner you ask someone, sooner theyâll all leave you alone and you can ââ\n","\n","But her face suddnly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were i ntertwined in the same armchair.\n","\n","âWell, good night, Harryâ said Hermione, though it was only seven oâclock in the evening, and she left for the girl sâ dormitory without another word.\n","\n","Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughornâs party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behaviorâ¦\n","\n","But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ronâs disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ronâs just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her.\n","\n","He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girlâs bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.\n","\n","âOh, hello, Harry , â said Luna . â D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?â\n","\n","âHi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuffâ¦â\n","\n","He held out her books.\n","\n","âOh, yes,â said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. âThank you , Harry. Well, Iâd better get goingâ¦â\n","\n","And she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.\n","\n","âSheâs a bit upset , â said Luna. âI thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasleyâ¦â\n","\n","âYeah, theyâve had a row,â said Harry.\n","\n","âHe says funny things sometimes, doesnât he?â said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. âBut he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.â\n","\n","â I sâpose , â said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. âSo have you had a good term?â\n","\n","âOh, itâs been al l right,â said Luna. â A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginnyâs been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me âLoonyâ the other day ââ\n","\n","âHow would you like to come to S lughornâs party with me tonight?â\n","\n","The words were out of Harryâs mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.\n","\n","Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise.\n","\n","âSlughornâs party? With you?â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry, âWeâre supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like.. I meanâ¦â He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. â I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you donât want toâ¦â\n","\n","He was already half hoping that she didnât want to.\n","\n","âO h no, Iâd love to go with you as friends!â said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. âNobodyâs ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too?â\n","\n","âNoâ said Harry firmly, âThat was a mistake. Iâll get Hermione to put it right for me. So Iâll meet you in the entrance hall at eight oâclock then . â\n","\n","âAHA!â screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.\n","\n","âPotty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony!â\n","\n","And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, âPotty loves Loony!â\n","\n","âNice to keep these things private,â said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughornâs party.\n","\n","âYou couldâve taken anyone!â said Ron in disbelief over dinner. âAnyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?â\n","\n","âDonât call her that, Ron!â snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. âIâm really glad youâre taking her Harry, sheâs so excited.â\n","\n","And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively.\n","\n","âYou could say sorry , â suggested Harry bluntly.\n","\n","âWhat , and get attacked by another flock of canaries?â muttered Ron.\n","\n","âWhat did you have to imitate her for?â\n","\n","âShe laughed at my mustache!â\n","\n","âSo did I, it was the stupidest thing Iâve ever seen.â\n","\n","But Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ronâs neck.\n","\n","âHi, Harry,â said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.\n","\n","âHi,â said Harry, âHowâre you? Youâre staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.â\n","\n","âI managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,â said Parvati. âThat Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasnât been anything sinceâ¦ Oh, hi, Hermione!â\n","\n","Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.\n","\n","âHi, Parvati!â said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. âAre you going to Slughornâs party tonight?â\n","\n","âNo invite,â said Parvati gloomily. âIâd love to go, though, it sounds like itâs going to be really goodâ¦ Youâre going, arenât you?â\n","\n","âYes, Iâm meeting Cormac at eight, and weâre -â\n","\n","There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.\n","\n","â- weâre going up to the party together.â\n","\n","âCormac?â said Parvati. âCormac McLaggen, you mean?â\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Hermione sweetly. âThe one who *almost*â - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - âbec a me Gryffindor Keeper.â\n","\n","âAre you going out with him, then?â asked Parvati, wideeyed.\n","\n","âOh - yes - didnât you know?â said Harmione, with a most unHermioneish giggle.\n","\n","âNo!â said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. âWow , you like your Quidditch players, donât you? First Krum, then McLaggen.â\n","\n","âI like *really good* Quidditch players,â Hermione corrected her, still smiling. âWell, see youâ¦ Got to go and get ready for the partyâ¦â\n","\n","She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\n","\n","When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight oâclock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.\n","\n","âHi,â he said. âShall we get going then?â\n","\n","âOh yes,â she said happily. âWhere is the party?â\n","\n","âSlughornâs office,â said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. âDid you hear, thereâs supposed to be a vampire coming?â\n","\n","âRufus Scrimgeour?â asked Luna.\n","\n","âI - what?â said Harry, disconcerted. âYou mean the Minister of Magic?â\n","\n","âYes, heâs a vampire,â said Luna matteroffactly. âFather wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didnât want the truth to get out!â\n","\n","Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her fatherâs bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughornâs office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took.\n","\n","Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughornâs office was much larger than the usual teacherâs study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of houseelves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.\n","\n","âHarry, mâboy!â boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. âCome in, come in, so many people Iâd like you to meet!â\n","\n","Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harryâs arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Lunaâs hand and dragged her along with him.\n","\n","âHarry, Iâd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of â Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampiresâ - and, of course, his friend Sanguini.â\n","\n","Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harryâs hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.\n","\n","âHarry Potter, I am simply delighted!â said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harryâs face. âI was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, âWhere is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?ââ\n","\n","âEr,â said Harry, âwere you?â\n","\n","âJust as modest as Horace described!â said Worple. âBut seriouslyâ â his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike â âI would be delighted to write it myselfâ people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or fivehour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you â ask Sanguini here if it isnât quite â Sanguini, stay here!â added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. âHere, have a pasty,â said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguiniâs hand before turning his attention back to Harry. âMy dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea ââ\n","\n","âIâm definitely not interested,â said Harry firmly, âand Iâve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.â He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.\n","\n","âHermione! Hermione !â\n","\n","âHarry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna !â\n","\n","âWhatâs happened to you?â asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devilâs Snare.\n","\n","âOh, Iâve just escaped â I mean, Iâve just left Cormac,â she said. âUnder the mistletoe,â she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her.\n","\n","âServes you right for coming with him,â he told her severely. âI thought heâd annoy Ron most,â said Hermione dispassionately. âI debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole ââ\n","\n","âYou considered Smith?â said Harry, revoked.\n","\n","âYes, I did, and Iâm starting to wish Iâd chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Letâs go this way, weâll be able to see him coming, heâs so tall. . . .â The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.\n","\n","âHello,â said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.\n","\n","âGood evening, my dear,â said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. âI havenât seen you in my classes lately. ..â\n","\n","âNo, Iâve got Firenze this year,â said Luna.\n","\n","âOh, of course,â said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. âOr Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no â¦ we share classes. . . . Itâs an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know. . .â Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry.\n","\n","Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, âLet â s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?â\n","\n","Hermione raised her eyebrows. âDo you really think Iâd stoop that low?â\n","\n","Harry looked at her shrewdly. âHermione, if you can ask 0111 McLaggen ââ\n","\n","âThereâs a difference,â said Hermione with dignity. âIâve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.â\n","\n","âGood,â said Harry fervently. âBecause heâll just fall apart again, and weâll lose the next match ââ\n","\n","âQuidditch!â said Hermione angrily. âIs that all boys care about? Cormac hasnât asked me one single question about myself, no, Iâve just been treated to âA Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggenâ nonstop ever since â oh no, here he comes!â She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished.\n","\n","âSeen Hermione?â asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later.\n","\n","âNo, sorry,â said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Lunaâs conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.\n","\n","âHarry Potter!â said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.\n","\n","âOh, hello,â said Harry unenthusiastically.\n","\n","âMy dear boy!â she said in a very carrying whisper. âThe rumors! The stories! âThe Chosen Oneâ! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!â\n","\n","âAh, Sybi l l, we all think our subjectâs most important!â said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. âBut I donât t hink Iâve ever known such a natural at Potions!â said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. âInstinctive, you know â like his mother! Iâve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybi l l â why even Severus ââ And to Harryâs horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them. âStop skulking and come and join us, Severus!â hiccuped Slughorn happily. âI was just talking about Harryâs exceptional potionmaking! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!â\n","\n","Trapped, with Slughorns arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed. âFunny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.â\n","\n","âWell, then, itâs natural ability!â shouted Slughorn. âYou should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death â never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I donât think even you, Severus ââ\n","\n","âReally?â said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.\n","\n","âRemind me what other subjects youâre taking, Harry?â asked Slughorn .\n","\n","âDefense Against the D ark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration , Herbologyâ¦â\n","\n","âAll the subjects required, in short, for an Auror ,â said Snap e with the faintest sneer.\n","\n","âYeah, well, thatâs what Iâd like to do,â said Harry defiantly.\n","\n","âAnd a great one youâll make too!â boomed Slughorn.\n","\n","âI donât think you should be an Auror, Harry,â said Luna unex pectedly. Everybody looked at her. âThe Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. Theyâre planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.â\n","\n","Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to lau gh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging, from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malf o y being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.\n","\n","âProfessor Slughorn,â wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischiefdetection in his bulging eyes, âI discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?â\n","\n","Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip, looking furious. âAll right, I wasnât invited!â he said angrily. âI was trying to gate crash, happy?â\n","\n","âNo, Iâm not!â said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. âYouâre in trouble, you are! Didnât the headma ster say that nighttime prowling â s out, unless youâve got permission, didnât he, eh?â\n","\n","âThatâs all right, Argus, thatâs all right,â said Slughorn, waving it 1.1 nd. âItâs Christmas, and itâs not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once, weâll forget any punishment; you may stay , Draco.\n","\n","Fil ichâs expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible? â¦ a lit tl afraid? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snapeâs face was smoothly inscrutable again.\n","\n","âItâs nothing, nothing,â said Slughorn, waving away Malfoyâs t hanks. âI did know your grandfather, after allâ¦.â\n","\n","âHe always spoke very highly of you, sir,â said Malfoy quickly. âSaid you were the best potionmaker heâd ever known. â¦â\n","\n","Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the suckingup that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.\n","\n","âIâd like a word with you, Draco,â said Snape suddenly.\n","\n","âNow , Severus,â said Slughorn, hiccuping again, âitâs Christ mas, do nât be too hard ââ\n","\n","âI am his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,â said Snape curtly. âFollow me, Draco.â\n","\n","They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, âIâll be back in a bit, Luna â er â bathroom.â\n","\n","âAll right,â she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely in terested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughornâs office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons â¦ or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.\n","\n","â . . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled ââ\n","\n","âI didnât have anything to do with it, all right?â\n","\n","âI hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy a nd foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.â\n","\n","âWho suspects me?â said Malfoy angrily. âFor the last time, I didnât do it, okay? That Bell girl must â ve had an enemy no on e knows about â donât look at me like that! I know what youâre doing, Iâm not stupid, but it wonât work â I can stop you!â\n","\n","There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, âAh . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?â\n","\n","âIâm not trying to conceal anything from him, I just donât want you butting in !â Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this â Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?\n","\n","âSo that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco ââ\n","\n","âSo put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!â jeered Malfoy.\n","\n","There was another pause. Then Snape said, âYou know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .â\n","\n","âYouâd better stop telling me to come to your office then!â\n","\n","âListen to me,â said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. âI am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco ââ\n","\n","âLooks like youâll have to break it, then, because I donât need your protection! Itâs my job, he gave it to me and Iâm doing it, Iâve got a plan and itâs going to work, itâs just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!â\n","\n","âWhat is your plan ?â\n","\n","âItâs none of your business !â\n","\n","â If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you â¦â\n","\n","âI have all the assistance I need, thanks, Iâm not alone!â\n","\n","âYou were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes ââ\n","\n","âI wouldâve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadnât put them in detention!â\n","\n","âKeep your voice down!â spat Snape, for Malfoy â s voice had risen excitedly. âIf your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres ââ\n","\n","âWhat does it matter?â said Malfoy. âDefense Against the Dark Arts â its all just a joke, isnât it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts ââ\n","\n","âIt is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!â said Snape. âWhere do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle ââ\n","\n","âTheyâre not the only ones, Iâve got other people on my side, better people!â\n","\n","âThen why not confide in me, and I can ââ\n","\n","âI know what youâre up to! You want to steal my glory!â\n","\n","There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, âYou are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you, but ââ\n","\n","Harry had barely a second â s warning; he heard Malfoyâs footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 16: AVeryFrosty Christmas\n","\n","\n","âSo Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?â\n","\n","âIf you ask. that once more,â said Harry, âIâm going to stick this sprout ââ\n","\n","âIâm only checking!â said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrowâs kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\n","\n","âYes, Snape was offering to help him!â said Harry. âHe said heâd promised Malfoyâs mother to protect him, that heâd made an Unbreakable Oath or something ââ\n","\n","âAn Unbreakable Vow?â said Ron, looking stunned. âNah, he canât have. . . . Are you sure?â\n","\n","âYes, Iâm sure,â said Harry. âWhy, what does it mean?â\n","\n","âWell, you canât break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .â\n","\n","âIâd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?â\n","\n","âYou die,â said Ron simply. âFred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,â said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. âOnly time Iâve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.â\n","\n","âYeah, well, passing over Fredâs left buttock ââ\n","\n","âI beg your pardon?â said Fredâs voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\n","\n","âAaah, George, look at this. Theyâre using knives and everything. Bless them.â\n","\n","âIâll be seventeen in two and a bit monthsâ time,â said Ron grumpily, âand then Iâll be able to do it by magic!â\n","\n","âBut meanwhile,â said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, âwe can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a â whoopsadaisy!â\n","\n","âYou made me do that!â said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. âYou wait, when Iâm seventeen ââ\n","\n","âIâm sure youâll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,â yawned Fred.\n","\n","âAnd speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,â said George, âwhat is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called â unless our information is faulty â Lavender Brown?â\n","\n","Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. âMind your own business.â\n","\n","âWhat a snappy retort,â said Fred. âI really donât know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know wasâ¦ how did it happen?â\n","\n","âWhat dâyou mean?â\n","\n","âDid she have an accident or something?â\n","\n","âWhat?â ..Â¦;\n","\n","âWell, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!â\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,\n","\n","âRon!â she said furiously. âDonât you ever let me see you throwing knives again!â\n","\n","âI wont,â said Ron, âlet you see,â he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\n","\n","âFred, George, Iâm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.â ;\n","\n","âNo problem,â said George.\n","\n","- âThen, as Charlie isnât coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;Â¦/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny ââ ââ thatâll make Ginnyâs Christmas ââ muttered Fred. ââ everyone should be comfortable. Well, theyâll have a bed, anyway,â said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\n","\n","âPercy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?â asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. âNo, heâs busy, I expect, at the Ministry.â\n","\n","âOr heâs the worldâs biggest prat,â said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. âOne of the two. âWell, letâs get going, then, George.â\n","\n","âWhat are you two up to?â asked Ron. âCant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then weâll be free\n","\n","too!â\n","\n","âNo, I donât think we can do that,â said Fred seriously. âItâs very characterbuilding stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs ââ ââ and if you want people to help you, Ron,â added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, âI wouldnât chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. Weâre off to the village, thereâs a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . , almost like real magic. â¦â\n","\n","âGits,â said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. âWouldâve only taken them ten seconds and then we couldâve gone too.â\n","\n","âI couldnât,â said Harry. âI promised Dumbledore I wouldnât wander off while Iâm staying here.â\n","\n","âOh yeah,â said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, âAre you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?â\n","\n","âYep,â said Harry. âIâm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledoreâs top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.â\n","\n","âPity you didnât hear what Malfoyâs actually doing, though.â âI couldnât have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.â\n","\n","There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, â âCourse, you know what theyâll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? Theyâll say Snape isnât really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoyâs up to.â\n","\n","âThey didnât hear him,â said Harry flatly. âNo oneâs that good an actor, not even Snape.â\n","\n","âYeah . . . Iâm just saying, though/â said Ron.\n","\n","Harry turned to face him, frowning. âYou think Iâm right, though?â ,\n","\n","âYeah, I do!â said Ron hastily. âSeriously, I do! But theyâre all convinced Snapeâs in the Order, arenât they?â\n","\n","Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what heâs doing. . . .\n","\n","This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughornâs party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal goodbye just behind him at the time.\n","\n","Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying âI told you so,â which he had done several times to Ron already.\n","\n","Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paperchain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\n","\n","They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called âA Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,â Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more raggedlooking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.\n","\n","Oh, come and stir my cauldron,\n","\n","And if you do it right,\n","\n","Iâll boil you up some hot strong love\n","\n","To keep you warm tonight.\n","\n","âWe danced to this when we were eighteen!â said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. âDo you remember, Arthur?â\n","\n","âMphf?â said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. âOh yes â¦ marvelous tune . . .â\n","\n","With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\n","\n","âSorry about this,â he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. âBe over soon.â\n","\n","âNo problem,â said Harry, grinning. âHas it been busy at the Ministry?â\n","\n","âVery,â said Mr. Weasley. âI wouldnât mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests weâve made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater â only donât repeat that, Harry,â he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\n","\n","âTheyâre not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âIâm afraid so,â said Mr. Weasley. âI know Dumbledoreâs tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. â¦ I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that heâs about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though theyâre making some progress, and âthree arrestsâ sounds better than âthree mistaken arrests and releasesâ. . . but again, this is\n","\n","all top secret. . . .â\n","\n","âI wonât say anything,â said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called âYou Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.â\n","\n","âMr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?â\n","\n","âI checked, Harry,â said Mr. Weasley at once. âI went and searched the Malfoysâ house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldnât have been there.â\n","\n","âYeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that youâd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more â¦â\n","\n","And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between\n","\n","Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupinâs head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestinaâs crooning.\n","\n","Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? Itâs left me for a spellâ¦\n","\n","âHas it occurred to you, Harry,â said Mr. Weasley, âthat Snape was simply pretending â ?â\n","\n","âPretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoyâs up to?â said Harry quickly. âYeah, I thought youâd say that. But how do we know?â\n","\n","âIt isnât our business to know,â said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. âItâs Dumbledoreâs business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.â\n","\n","âBut,â said Harry, âjust say â just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape ââ\n","\n","âPeople have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledoreâs judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.â\n","\n","âBut Dumbledore can make mistakes,â argued Harry. âHe says it himself. And youâ â he looked Lupin straight in the eye â âdo you honestly like Snape?â\n","\n","âI neither like nor dislike Severus,â said Lupin. âNo, Harry, I am speaking the truth,â he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. âWe shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.â\n","\n","âBut he âaccidentallyâ let it slip that youâre a werewolf, so you had to leave!â said Harry angrily.\n","\n","Lupin shrugged. âThe news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.â\n","\n","âMaybe he didnât dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!â said Harry.\n","\n","âYou are determined to hate him, Harry,â said Lupin with a faint smile. âAnd I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledoreâs orders that Severus questioned Draco.â ;\n","\n",". . . and now youâve torn it quite apart Iâll thank you to give back my heart!\n","\n","Celestina ended her song on a very long, highpitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\n","\n","âEez eet over?â said Fleur loudly. âThank goodness, what an âorrible ââ\n","\n","âShall we have a nightcap, then?â asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. âWho wants eggnog?â\n","\n","âWhat have you been up to lately?â Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\n","\n","âOh, Iâve been underground,â said Lupin. âAlmost literally. Thatâs why I havenât been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.â -:\n","\n","âWhat do you mean?â â\n","\n","âIâve been living among my fellows, my equals,â said Lupin. âWerewolves,â he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. âNearly all of them are on Voldemortâs side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . readymade.â\n","\n","He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, âI am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing â and sometimes killing â to eat.â\n","\n","âHow come they like Voldemort?â\n","\n","âThey think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,â said Lupin. âAnd it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .â\n","\n","âWhoâs Greyback?â\n","\n","âYou havenât heard of him?â Lupinâs hands closed convulsively in his lap. âFenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon peopleâs sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.â\n","\n","Lupin paused and then said, âIt was Greyback who bit me.â âWhat?â said Harry, astonished. âWhen â when you were a kid, you mean?â\n","\n","âYes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greybackâs insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.â âBut you are normal!â said Harry fiercely. âYouâve just got a â a\n","\n","problem ââ\n","\n","Lupin burst out laughing. âSometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my âfurry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved\n","\n","rabbit.â\n","\n","He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.\n","\n","âHave you ever heard of someone called the HalfBlood Prince?â\n","\n","âThe HalfBlood what?â\n","\n","âPrince,â said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.\n","\n","âThere are no Wizarding princes,â said Lupin, now smiling. âIs this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being âthe Chosen Oneâ would be enough.â\n","\n","âItâs nothing to do with me!â said Harry indignantly. âThe HalfBlood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, Iâve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus ââ\n","\n","âOh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,â said Lupin reminiscently. âThere were a few months in my fifth year when you couldnât move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.â\n","\n","âMy dad used it,â said Harry. âI saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.â\n","\n","He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.\n","\n","âYes,â he said, âbut he wasnât the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .â\n","\n","âBut it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,â Harry persisted.\n","\n","âNot necessarily,â said Lupin. âJinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.â\n","\n","He looked into Harryâs face and then said quietly, âJames was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him âPrince.ââ\n","\n","Abandoning pretense, Harry said, âAnd it wasnât Sirius? Or you?â\n","\n","âDefinitely not.â\n","\n","âOh.â Harry stared into the fire. âI just thought â well, heâs helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.â\n","\n","âHow old is this book, Harry?â\n","\n","âI dunno, Iâve never checked.â\n","\n","âWell, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,â said Lupin.\n","\n","Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing âA Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,â which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasleyâs expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ronâs attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\n","\n","Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced PotionMaking before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his fatherâs friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the HalfBlood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\n","\n","âSheâs got to be joking. . . .â\n","\n","Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.\n","\n","âWhatâs chat?â asked Harry. â\n","\n","âIts from Lavender,â said Ron, sounding revolted^ âShe earn\n","\n","honestly think Iâd wear â¦â\n","\n","Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan\n","\n","gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\n","\n","âMy sweetheartâ\n","\n","âNice,â he said. âClassy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.â\n","\n","âIf you tell them,â said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, âI â I â Iâll ââ\n","\n","âStutter at me?â said Harry, grinning. âCome on, would I?â\n","\n","âHow could she think Iâd like something like that, though?â Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\n","\n","âWell, think back,â said Harry. âHave you ever let it slip that youâd like to go out in public with the words âMy Sweetheartâ round your neck?â\n","\n","âWellâ¦ we donât really talk much,â said Ron. âItâs mainly . . .â\n","\n","âSnogging,â said Harry.\n","\n","âWell, yeah,â said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, âIs Hermione really going out with McLaggen?â\n","\n","âI dunno,â said Harry. âThey were at Slughornâs party together, but I donât think it went that well.â\n","\n","Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\n","\n","Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, handknitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleysâ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldysmelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher,\n","\n","Harry stared at it. âDâyou reckon this is safe to open?â he asked. âCanât be anything dangerous, all our mailâs still being searched at the Ministry,â replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\n","\n","âI didnât think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their houseelves Christmas presents?â asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\n","\n","âHermione would,â said Ron. âBut letâs wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.â\n","\n","A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. âNice,â said Ron, roaring with laughter. âVery thoughtful.â âIâd rather have them than that necklace,â said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\n","\n","Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brandnew midnight blue witchâs hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.\n","\n","âFred and George gave them to me! Arenât they beautiful?â .: âWell, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now weâre washing our own socks,â said George, waving an airy hand. âParsnips, Remus?â\n","\n","âHarry, youâve got a maggot in your hair,â said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\n","\n","ââOw âorrible,â said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\n","\n","âYes, isnât it?â said Ron. âGravy, Fleur?â\n","\n",". In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\n","\n","âYou are as bad as zat Tonks,â said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. âShe is always knocking ââ\n","\n","âI invited dear Tonks to come along today,â said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. âBut she wouldnât come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?â\n","\n","âNo, I havenât been in contact with anybody very much,â said Lupin. âBut Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasnât she?â\n","\n","âHmmm,â said Mrs. Weasley. âMaybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.â\n","\n","She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughterinlaw instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a longlost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\n","\n","âTonksâs Patronus has changed its form,â he told him. âSnape said so anyway. I didnât know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?â\n","\n","Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, âSometimes â¦ a great shock â¦ an emotional upheaval â¦â\n","\n","âIt looked big, and it had four legs,â said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. âHey â¦ it couldnât be â ?â\n","\n","âArthur!â said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. âArthur â itâs Percy!â\n","\n","âWhat?â\n","\n","Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his hornrimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\n","\n","âArthur, heâs â heâs with the Minister!â\n","\n","And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percyâs wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\n","\n","There was a momentâs painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, âMerry Christmas, Mother.â\n","\n","âOh, Percy!â said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\n","\n","Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\n","\n","âYou must forgive this intrusion,â he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. âPercy and I were in the vicinity â working, you know â and he couldnât resist dropping in and seeing you all.â\n","\n","But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, pokerstraight and awkwardlooking, and stared over everybody elseâs heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stonyfaced.\n","\n","âPlease, come in, sit down, Minister!â fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. â¦ 1 â. mean ââ\n","\n","âNo, no, my dear Molly,â said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. âI donât want to intrude, wouldnât be here at all if Percy hadnât wanted to see you all so badly. . . .â\n","\n","âOh, Perce!â said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\n","\n","â. , . Weâve only looked in for five minutes, so Iâll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I donât want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young manâs finished, why doesnât he take a stroll with me?â\n","\n","The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeourâs pretense that he did not know Harryâs name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\n","\n","âYeah, all right,â said Harry into the silence.\n","\n","He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeourâs talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\n","\n","âItâs fine,â he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. âFine,â he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\n","\n","âWonderful!â said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass\n","\n","through the door ahead of him. âWeâll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and Iâll be off. Carry on, everyone!â\n","\n","Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleysâ overgrown, snowcovered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battlescarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\n","\n","âCharming,â said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. âCharming.â\n","\n","Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\n","\n","âIâve wanted to meet you for a very long time,â said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. âDid you know that?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry truthfully. Â¦!.\n","\n","âOh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,â said Scrimgeour. âNatural, of course, natural, after what youâve been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry â¦â:\n","\n","He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, âI have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has â most understandably, as I say â prevented this.â\n","\n","Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.\n","\n","âThe rumors that have flown around!â said Scrimgeour. âWell, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted â¦ all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being âthe Chosen Oneâ. . .â\n","\n","They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.\n","\n","âI assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?â,\n","\n","Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffedup patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth â¦ or a bit of it.\n","\n","âYeah, weâve discussed it.â\n","\n","âHave you, have you . . .â said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. âAnd what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?â\n","\n","âSorry, but thatâs between us,â said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeourâs tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, âOh, of course, if itâs a question of confidences, I wouldnât want you to divulge . . . no, no â¦ and in any case, does it really matter whether you are âthe Chosen Oneâ or not?â\n","\n","Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. âI donât really know what you mean, Minister.â\n","\n","âWell, of course, to you it will matter enormously,â said Scrimgeour with a laugh. âBut to the Wizarding community at large . . . itâs all perception, isnât it? Itâs what people believe thatâs important.â\n","\n","Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\n","\n","âPeople believe you are âthe Chosen One,â you see,â said Scrimgeour. âThey think you quite the hero â which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced HeWhoMustNotBeNamed now? Well, anyway,â he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, âthe point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy HeWhoMustNotBeNamed â well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I canât help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.â\n","\n","The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, âFunny little chaps, arenât they? But what say you, Harry?â\n","\n","âI donât exactly understand what you want,â said Harry slowly. ââStand alongside the Ministryâ . . . What does that mean?â\n","\n","âOh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,â said Scrimgeour. âIf you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. â¦â\n","\n","Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\n","\n","âSo basically,â he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, âyouâd like to give the impression that Iâm working for the Ministry?â\n","\n","âIt would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,â said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. ââThe Chosen One,â you know. . . Itâs all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. â¦â\n","\n","âBut if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,â said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, âwonât that seem as though I approve of what the Ministryâs up to?â\n","\n","âWell,â said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, âwell, yes, thatâs partly why weâd like ââ\n","\n","âNo, I donât think thatâll work,â said Harry pleasantly. âYou see, I donât like some of the things the Ministryâs doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.â\n","\n","Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. âI would not expect you to understand,â he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. âThese are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old ââ\n","\n","âDumbledoreâs a lot older than sixteen, and he doesnât think Stan should be in Azkaban either,â said Harry. âYouâre making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.â\n","\n","They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, âI see. You prefer â like your hero, Dumbledore â to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?â âI donât want to be used,â said Harry.\n","\n","âSome would say itâs your duty to be used by the Ministry!â âYeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,â said Harry, his temper rising now. âYouâre doing what Barty Crouch\n","\n","did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either weâve got Fudge, pretending everythingâs lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or weâve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend youâve got âthe Chosen Oneâ working for you!â â i\n","\n","âSo youâre not âthe Chosen Oneâ?â said Scrimgeour. â\n","\n","âI thought you said it didnât matter either way?â said Harry, with a bitter laugh. âNot to you anyway.â\n","\n","âI shouldnât have said that,â said Scrimgeour quickly. âIt was tactless ââ\n","\n","âNo, it was honest,â said Harry. âOne of the only honest things youâve said to me. You donât care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone youâre winning the war against Voldemort. I havenât forgotten, Ministerâ¦.â\n","\n","He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\n","\n","âI donât remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasnât so keen to be pals last year.â\n","\n","They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.\n","\n","âWhat is Dumbledore up to?â said Scrimgeour brusquely. âWhere does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?â\n","\n","âNo idea,â said Harry.\n","\n","âAnd you wouldnât tell me if you knew,â said Scrimgeour, âwould you?â\n","\n","âNo, 1 wouldnât,â said Harry.\n","\n","âWell, then, I shall have to see whether I canât find out by other means.â\n","\n","âYou can try,â said Harry indifferently. âBut you seem cleverer than Fudge, so Iâd have thought youâd have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed heâs not Minister anymore, but Dumbledoreâs still headmaster. Iâd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.â\n","\n","There was a long pause.\n","\n","âWell, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,â said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wirerimmed glasses, âDumbledoreâs man through and through, arenât you, Potter?â\n","\n","âYeah, I am,â said Harry. âGlad we straightened that out.â\n","\n","And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 17: A Sluggish Memory\n","\n","\n","Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this oneoff connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say goodbye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit).\n","\n","âDonât cry, Mum,â said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. âItâs okay. â¦â\n","\n","âYeah, donât worry about us,â said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, âor about Percy. Heâs such a prat, itâs not really a loss, is it?â\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.\n","\n","âPromise me youâll look after yourself.. .. Stay out of trouble. â¦â\n","\n","âI always do, Mrs. Weasley,â said Harry. âI like a quiet life, you know me.â\n","\n","She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. âBe good, then, all of you. â¦â\n","\n","Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted âHogwarts!â He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleysâ kitchen and Mrs. Weasleyâs tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagallâs office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.\n","\n","âEvening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.â\n","\n","âNo, Professor.â\n","\n","Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagallâs office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.\n","\n","âBaubles,â said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.\n","\n","âNo,â she said.\n","\n","âWhat dâyou mean, ânoâ ?\n","\n","âThere is a new password,â she said. âAnd please donât shout.â\n","\n","âBut weâve been away, howâre we supposed to â ?â\n","\n","âHarry! Ginny!â\n","\n","Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pinkfaced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.\n","\n","âI got back a couple of hours ago, Iâve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck â I mean Witherwings,â she said breathlessly. âDid you have a good Christmas?â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Ron at once, âpretty eventful, Rufus Scrim ââ ] âIâve got something for you, Harry,â said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. âOh, hang on â password. Abstinence.â\n","\n","âPrecisely,â said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.\n","\n","âWhatâs up with her?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âOverindulged over Christmas, apparently,â said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. âShe and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anywayâ¦â\n","\n","She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledoreâs writing on it.\n","\n","âGreat,â said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. âIâve got loads to tell him â and you. Letâs sit down ââ\n","\n","But at that moment there was a loud squeal of âWonWon!â and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ronâs arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, âThereâs a cable over hereâ¦ Coming. Ginny?â\n","\n","âNo, thanks, I said Iâd meet Dean,â said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling, match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.\n","\n","âSo how was your Christmas?â\n","\n","âOh, fine,â she shrugged. âNothing special. How was it at WonWonâs?â\n","\n","âIâll tell you in a minute,â said Harry. âLook, Hermione, canât you ââ\n","\n","âNo, I canât,â she said flatly. âSo donât even ask.â\n","\n","âI thought maybe, you know, over Christmas ââ\n","\n","âIt was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of fivehundredyearold wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?â\n","\n","She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, âDonât you think â ?â\n","\n","ââ he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what heâs doing?â\n","\n","âWell, yes,â said Hermione.\n","\n","âRonâs dad and Lupin think so,â Harry said grudgingly. âBut this definitely proves Malfoyâs planning something, you canât deny that.â\n","\n","âNo, I canât,â she answered slowly.\n","\n","âAnd heâs acting on Voldemortâs orders, just like I said!â\n","\n","âHmm .. . did either of them actually mention Voldemortâs name?â\n","\n","Harry frowned, trying to remember. âIâm not sure â¦ Snape definitely said âyour master,â and who else would that be?â\n","\n","âI donât know,â said Hermione, biting her lip. âMaybe his father?â\n","\n","She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. âHowâs Lupin?â\n","\n","âNot great,â said Harry, and he told her all about Lupinâs mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. âHave you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?â\n","\n","âYes, I have!â said Hermione, sounding startled. âAnd so have you, Harry!â\n","\n","âWhen, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened â¦â\n","\n","âNo, no, not History of Magic â Malfoy threatened Borgin with Kim!â said Hermione. âBack in Knockturn Alley, donât you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that heâd be checking up on Borginâs progress!â\n","\n","Harry gaped at her. âI forgot! But this proves Malfoy s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?â\n","\n","âIt is pretty suspicious,â breathed Hermione. âUnless . . .â âOh, come on,â said Harry in exasperation, âyou canât get round this one!â\n","\n","âWell . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.â âYouâre unbelievable, you are,â said Harry, shaking his head.\n","\n","âWeâll see whoâs right. . . . Youâll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, 1 had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . .â\n","\n","And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.\n","\n","The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.\n","\n","APPARITION LESSONS\n","\n","If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelveweek course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.\n","\n","Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, âGuess who, WonWon?â Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.\n","\n","âSo â Apparition,â said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. âShould be a laugh, eh?â\n","\n","âI dunno,â said Harry. âMaybe itâs better when you do it yourself, I didnât enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.â\n","\n","âI forgot youâd already done it. â¦ Iâd better pass my test first\n","\n","time,â said Ron, looking anxious. âFred and George did,â âCharlie failed, though, didnât he?â âYeah, but Charlieâs bigger than meâ â Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla â âso Fred and George\n","\n","didnât go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .â âWhen can we take the actual test?â âSoon as weâre seventeen. Thatâs only March for me!â âYeah, but you wouldnât be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . .â\n","\n","âNot the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted.â\n","\n","Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming , lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.\n","\n","âHow cool will it be when we can just ââ Seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance. âMe cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back. . . Heâll never have another peaceful moment. . . .â\n","\n","Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of todayâs Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.\n","\n","âHarryâs already Apparated,â Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: âI am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.â âDum â er â someone took him. SideAlongApparition, you know.â\n","\n","âWhoa!â whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore.\n","\n","The lamps in Dumbledoreâs office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledoreâs hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burntlooking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.\n","\n","âI hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?â âYes,â said Harry. âHeâs not very happy with me.â\n","\n","âNo,â sighed Dumbledore. âHe is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.â\n","\n","Harry grinned.\n","\n","âHe wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministryâs doing a wonderful job.â\n","\n","Dumbledore smiled.\n","\n","âIt was Fudgeâs idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your\n","\n","support ââ\n","\n","âAfter everything Fudge did last year?â said Harry angrily. âAfter Umbridge ?â\n","\n","âI told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left: office. Within hours of Scrimgeourâs appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you ââ\n","\n","âSo thatâs why you argued!â Harry blurted out. âIt was in the Daily Prophetââ\n","\n","âThe Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,â said Dumbledore, âif only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.â\n","\n","âHe accused me of being âDumbledoreâs man through and through.ââ\n","\n","âHow very rude of him.â\n","\n","âI told him I was.â\n","\n","Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harryâs intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized\n","\n","that Dumbledoreâs bright blue eyes looked rather watery, ami stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.\n","\n","âI am very touched, Harry.â\n","\n","âScrimgeour wanted to know where you go when youâre not at Hogwarts,â said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.\n","\n","âYes, he is very nosy about that,â said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. âHe has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasnât kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.â\n","\n","âSo they still donât know where you go?â asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his halfmoon spectacles.\n","\n","âNo, they donât, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless thereâs anything else â ?â âThere is, actually, sir,â said Harry. âItâs about Malfoy and Snape.â\n","\n","âProfessor Snape, Harry.â\n","\n","âYes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party . . . well, I followed them, actually. â¦â\n","\n","Dumbledore listened to Harryâs story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, âThank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.â\n","\n","âNot of great importance?â repeated Harry incredulously. âProfessor, did you understand â ?â\n","\n","âYes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,â said Dumbledore, a little sharply. âI think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have conlided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.â\n","\n","Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be?\n","\n","âSo, sir,â said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, âyou definitely still trust â ?â\n","\n","âI have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,â said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. âMy answer has not changed.â\n","\n","âI should think not,â said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.\n","\n","âAnd now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.â\n","\n","Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harryâs mind, Dumbledore shook his head.\n","\n","âAh, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!â\n","\n","âI donât think what youâve got to say is unimportant, sir,â said Harry stiffly.\n","\n","âWell, you are quite right, because it is not,â said Dumbledore briskly. âI have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, 1 think, the most important I have collected.â\n","\n","Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.\n","\n","âSo,â said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, âwe meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.\n","\n","âWell, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,â continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. âHow soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know â perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of selfimportance.\n","\n","âHowever, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very goodlooking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed police, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.â\n","\n","âDidnât you tell them, sir, what heâd been like when you met him at the orphanage?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âNo, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.â\n","\n","Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledoreâs tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . .\n","\n","âBut you didnât really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, âDumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.ââ\n","\n","âLet us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,â said Dumbledore. âI had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues.\n","\n","âAs he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.\n","\n","âRigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.\n","\n","âI have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,â said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. âFew who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.\n","\n","âThose whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised motherâs family â the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.\n","\n","âAll he had to go upon was the single name âMarvolo,â which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his motherâs fatherâs name. Finally, after painstaking research, through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherinâs surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand â¦â :\n","\n","Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.\n","\n","âI was very lucky to collect this,â he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. âAs you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?â\n","\n","Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.\n","\n","It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gauntsâ house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But\n","\n","then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.\n","\n","The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an oldfashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, darkhaired, and handsome â the teenage Voldemort.\n","\n","Voldemortâs eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.\n","\n","âYOU!â he bellowed. âYOU!â\n","\n","And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.\n","\n","âStop.â\n","\n","Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it.\n","\n","âYou speak it?â\n","\n","âYes, I speak it,â said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemortâs complete lack of fear. His race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.\n","\n","âWhere is Marvolo?â he asked.\n","\n","âDead,â said the other. âDied years ago, didnât he?â\n","\n","Riddle frowned.\n","\n","âWho are you, then?â\n","\n","âIâm Morfin, ainât I?â\n","\n","âMarvoloâs son?â\n","\n","ââCourse I am, thenâ¦â â¢ ,, .\n","\n","Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvoloâs blackstoned ring on his right hand.\n","\n","âI thought you was that Muggle,â whispered Morfin. âYou look mighty like that Muggle.â\n","\n","âWhat Muggle?â said Riddle sharply.\n","\n","âThat Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way,â said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. âYou look right like him. Riddle. But heâs older now, in âe? Heâs olderân you, now I think on it. â¦â\n","\n","Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support. âHe come back, see,â he added stupidly.\n","\n","Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, âRiddle came back?â\n","\n","âAr, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!â said Morfin, spitting on the floor again. âRobbed us, mind, before she ran off. , Whereâs the locket, eh, whereâs Slytherinâs locket?â\n","\n","Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, âDishonored us, , she did, that little slut! And whore you, coming here and asking questions about all that? Itâs over, innit. . . . Itâs over. â¦â\n","\n","He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemortâs lamp and Morfinâs candle, extinguishing everything. . . . Dumbledoreâs fingers closed tightly around Harryâs arm and they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledoreâs office seemed to dazzle Harryâs eyes after that impenetrable darkness.\n","\n","âIs that all?â said Harry at once. âWhy did it go dark, what happened?â\n","\n","âBecause Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,â said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. âWhen he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvoloâs ring had gone.\n","\n","âMeanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father.\n","\n","âThe Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avadu Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me,â Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harryâs scar. âThe Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizardâs murder. They also knew that a convicted Mugglehater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Mugglehater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.\n","\n","âSo the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.\n","\n","All that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared. âHeâll kill me for losing it,â he told his captors over and over again. âHeâll kill me for losing his ring.â And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvoloâs last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.â\n","\n","âSo Voldemort stole Morfinâs wand and used it?â said Harry, sitting up straight.\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Dumbledore. âWe have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to âthe big house over the way.â There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncleâs mind, laid Morfinâs wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.â\n","\n","âAnd Morfin never realized he hadnât done it?â\n","\n","âNever,â said Dumbledore. âHe gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.â\n","\n","âBut he had this real memory in him all the time!â âYes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,â said Dumbledore, âand why should anybody delve further into Morfinâs mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemortâs past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfinâs release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.â\n","\n","âBut how come the Ministry didnât realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?â Harry asked angrily âHe was underage at the time, wasnât he? I thought they could detect underage magic!â âYou are quite right â they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by ââ\n","\n","âDobby,â growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. âSo if youâre underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizardâs house, the Ministry wonât know?â\n","\n","âThey will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,â said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face. âThey rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspringâs obedience while within their walls.â\n","\n","âWell, thatâs rubbish,â snapped Harry. âLook what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!â\n","\n","âI agree,â said Dumbledore. âWhatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. â¦â\n","\n","Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\n","\n","âThis will not take long,â said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. âWe shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . .â\n","\n","And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once.\n","\n","It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, strawcolored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleonsized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingeryblond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.\n","\n","Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughornâs office. Haifa dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their midteens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvoloâs goldandblack ring; he had already killed his father.\n","\n","âSir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?â he asked.\n","\n","âTom, Tom, if I knew I couldnât tell you,â said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugarcovered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. âI must say, Iâd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.â\n","\n","Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\n","\n","âWhat with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnât, and your careful flattery of the people who matter â thank you fm the pineapple, by the way, youâre quite right, it is my favorite â â\n","\n","As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then Slughornâs voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, âYouâll go wrong, boy, mark my words. â\n","\n","The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughornâs desk chimed eleven oâclock.\n","\n","âGood gracious, is it that time already?â said Slughorn. âYouâd better get going, boys, or weâll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or itâs detention. Same goes for you, Avery.â\n","\n","Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.\n","\n","âLook sharp, Tom,â said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. âYou donât want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefectâ¦â\n","\n","âSir, I wanted to ask you something.â\n","\n","âAsk away, then, mâboy, ask awayâ¦.â\n","\n","âSir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?â\n","\n","And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughornâs voice boomed out again, just as it had done before.\n","\n","âI donât know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldnât tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and donât let me catch you mentioning them again!â\n","\n","âWell, thatâs that,â said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry.\n","\n","âTime to go.â\n","\n","And Harryâs feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the\n","\n","rug in front of Dumbledoreâs desk.\n","\n","âThatâs all there is?â said Harry blankly.\n","\n","Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer.\n","\n","âAs you might have noticed,â said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, âthat memory has been tampered with.â\n","\n","âTampered with?â repeated Harry, sitting back down too.\n","\n","âCertainly,â said Dumbledore. âProfessor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.â\n","\n","âBut why would he do that?â\n","\n","âBecause, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,â said Dumbledore. âHe has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.\n","\n","âAnd so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.â\n","\n","Harry stared at him.\n","\n","âBut surely, sir,â he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, âyou donât need me â you could use Legilimency â¦ or Veritaserum. â¦â\n","\n","âProfessor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,â said Dumbledore. âHe is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.\n","\n","âNo, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.â\n","\n","A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. âGood night, sir.â\n","\n","As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, âI canât see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âI wouldnât expect you to, Phineas,â replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 18: Birthday Surprises\n","\n","\n","The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ronâs presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.\n","\n","Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.\n","\n","âHe loves you,â he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. âWonât refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.â\n","\n","Hermione, however, took a gloomier view.\n","\n","âHe must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldnât get it out of him,â she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. âHorcruxes â¦ Horcruxes â¦ Iâve never even heard of them â¦â\n","\n","âYou havenât?â\n","\n","Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.\n","\n","âThey must be really advanced Dark magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think itâs going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, youâll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy â¦â\n","\n","âRon reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon â¦â\n","\n","âOh, well, if WonWon thinks that, youâd better do it,â she said, flaring up at once. âAfter all, when has WonWonâs judgement ever been faulty?â\n","\n","âHermione, canât you ââ\n","\n","âNo!â she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankledeep in snow.\n","\n","Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.\n","\n","âWhatâve you done?â Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermioneâs haughty profile.\n","\n","But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.\n","\n","âSettle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalottâs Third Law â¦ who can tell me -? But Miss Granger can, of course!â\n","\n","Hermione recited at top speed: âGolpalottâsThirdLaw- statesthattheantidoteforablendedpoisonwillbeequalto- morethanthesumoftheantidotesforeachoftheseparale- components.â\n","\n","âPrecisely!â beamed Slughorn. Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalottâs Third Law as true â¦â\n","\n","Harry was going to have to take Slughornâs word for it that Golpalottâs Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next, either.\n","\n","ââ¦ which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potionâs ingredients by Scarpinâs Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a\n","\n","of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements -â\n","\n","Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth halfopen, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced PotionMaking. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.\n","\n","ââ¦ and so,â finished Slughorn, âI want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and donât forget your protective gloves!â\n","\n","Hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards Siughornâs desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.\n","\n","âitâs a shame that the Prince wonât be able to help you much with this, Harry,â she said brightly as she straightened up. âYou have to understand the principles involved this time. No short cuts or cheats!â\n","\n","Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Siughornâs desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.\n","\n","âYou sure the Prince hasnât got any tips?â Ron muttered to Harry.\n","\n","Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced PotionMaking and turned to the chapter on Antidotes. There was Golpalottâs Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Princeâs hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.\n","\n","âNothing,â said Harry gloomily.\n","\n","Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, âSpecialis revelio!â over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.\n","\n","It took Harry only five minutes to realise that his reputation as the best potionmaker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermioneâs expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the HalfBlood Princeâs book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.\n","\n","And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes.\n","\n","Just shove a bezoar down their throats.\n","\n","Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadnât he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadnât Snape mentioned them in their first ever Potions lesson? âA stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.â\n","\n","It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small card box on which had been scribbled the word âBezoarsâ.\n","\n","He opened the box just as Slughorn called, Two minutes left, everyone!â Inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking more like driedup kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron.\n","\n","âTimeâs â¦ UP!â called Slughorn genially. âWell, letâs see how youâve done! Blaise â¦ what have you got for me?â\n","\n","Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.\n","\n","Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernieâs potion and passed on to Ronâs with a grimace. He did not linger over Ronâs cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.\n","\n","âAnd you, Harry,â he said. âWhat have you got to show me?â\n","\n","Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.\n","\n","Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.\n","\n","âYouâve got a nerve, boy!â he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. âOh, youâre like your mother â¦ well, 1 canât fault you â¦ a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!â\n","\n","Hermione, who was sweatyfaced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her halffinished antidote, comprising fiftytwo ingredients including a chunk of her own hair,\n","\n","bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.\n","\n","âAnd you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?â she asked through gritted teeth.\n","\n","Thatâs the individual spirit a real potionmaker needs!â said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. âJust like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potionmaking, itâs undoubtedly from Lily he gets it â¦ yes, Harry, yes, if youâve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick â¦ although as they donât work on everything, and are pretty rare, itâs still worth knowing how to mix antidotes â¦â\n","\n","The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.\n","\n","Time to pack up!â said Slughorn. âAnd an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!â\n","\n","Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.\n","\n","Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.\n","\n","âCome on, now, Harry, youâll be late for your next lesson,â said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase.\n","\n","âSir,â said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, â1 wanted to ask you something.â\n","\n","âAsk away, then, my dear boy, ask away â¦â\n","\n","âSir, 1 wondered what you know about â¦ about Horcruxes?â\n","\n","Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, âWhat did you say?â âI asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see -â\n","\n","âDumbledore put you up to this,â whispered Slughorn.\n","\n","His voice had changed completely. It was not genial any more, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow.\n","\n","âDumbledoreâs shown you that - that memory,â said Slughorn. âWell?

Purplishgrey clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixthyearsâ first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.\n","\n","When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender) they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick and Sprout - the Heads of House - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition Instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.\n","\n","âGood morning,â said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of House had called for quiet. âMy name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your MinistryApparition Instructor for the next twelve weeks. 1 hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition test in this time -â\n","\n","âMalfoy, be quiet and pay attention!â barked Professor McGonagall.\n","\n","Everybody looked round. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoyâs rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his house.\n","\n","â- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your test,â Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.\n","\n","âAs you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The Headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practise. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.\n","\n","âI would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.â\n","\n","There was a great scrambiing and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of House moved among the students, marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments.\n","\n","âHarry, where are you going? 1 demanded Hermione.\n","\n","But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivvying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.\n","\n","âI donât know how much longer, all right?â Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. âItâs taking longer than I thought it would.â\n","\n","Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to secondguess what he was going to say.\n","\n","âLook, itâs none of your business what Iâm doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as youâre told and keep a lookout!â\n","\n","â! tell my friends what Iâm up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,â Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.\n","\n","Malfoy spun round on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, âQuiet!â and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front.\n","\n","Thank you,â said Twycross. :Now then â¦â\n","\n","He waved his wand. Oldfashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student.\n","\n","The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds!â said Twycross. âDestination, Determination, Deliberation!\n","\n","âStep one: fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,â said Twycross. âIn this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.â\n","\n","Everybody looked around furtively, to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldnât stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.\n","\n","âStep two,â said Twycross, âfocus your determination to occupy the visualised space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!â\n","\n","Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quafflesized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.\n","\n","âStep three,â called Twycross, âand only when 1 give the command â¦ lum on the spot, feeiing your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation 1. On my command, now â¦ one- 1\n","\n","Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.\n","\n","Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for.\n","\n",": - THREE!â\n","\n","Harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.\n","\n","âNever mind, never mind,â said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. âAdjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions â¦â\n","\n","The second atlem.pt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.\n","\n","The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.\n","\n","âSphânching, or the separation of random body parts,â said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, âoccurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continually upon your destination, and move, without hasie, but with deliberation â¦ thus.â\n","\n","Twycross stepped forwards, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. âRemember the three Ds,â he said, âand try again â¦ one -two - three -â\n","\n","But an hour later, Susanâs Splinching was still ihe most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, âUntil next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.â\n","\n","With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the Entrance Hall.\n","\n","âHow did you do?â asked Ron, hurrying towards Harry. â1 think 1 felt something the last time I tried - a kind of tingling in my feet.â\n","\n","â1 expect your trainers are too small, WonWon,â said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.\n","\n","â1 didnât feel anything,â said Harry, ignoring this interruption. âBut 1 donât care about that now-â\n","\n","âWhat dâyou mean, you donât care â¦ donât you want to leam to Apparate?â said Ron incredulously.\n","\n","âIâm not fussed, really. I prefer flying,â said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall. âLook, hurry up, will you, thereâs something I want to do â¦â\n","\n","Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.\n","\n","âAre you going to tell me what weâre doing, then?â asked Ron, panting slightly.\n","\n","âUp here,â said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boysâ staircase.\n","\n","Their dormitory was, as Hamâ had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.\n","\n","âHarry â¦â\n","\n","âMalfoyâs using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. 1 want to know â¦ aha.â\n","\n","He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with [he tip of his wand.\n","\n","âI solemn!)â swear that I am up to no good â¦ or Malfoy is,\n","\n","At once, the Marauderâs Map appeared on the parchmentâs surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castleâs floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labelled black dots that signified each of the castleâs occupants.\n","\n","âHelp me find Malfoy,â said Harry urgently.\n","\n","He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.\n","\n","âThere!â said Ron, after a minute or so. âHeâs in the Slytherin common room, look â¦ with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle â¦â\n","\n","Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.\n","\n","âWell, Iâm keeping an eye on him from now on,â he said firmly. âAnd the moment 1 see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, itâll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what heâs-â\n","\n","He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.\n","\n","Despite his determination 10 catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high leve! of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose ihat he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older - Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.\n","\n","February moved towards March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all commonroom noticeboards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been cancelled. Ron was furious.\n","\n","âIt was on my birthday!â he said, âi was looking forward to that!â\n","\n","âNot a big surprise, though, is it?â said Harry. âNot after what happened to Katie.â\n","\n","She had still not returned from Si Mungoâs. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.\n","\n","âBut now all Iâve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!â said Ron grumpily. âBig birthday treat â¦â\n","\n","Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as\n","\n","ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of illfeeling towards Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead.\n","\n","âHappy birthday, Ron,â said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. âHave a present.â\n","\n","He threw the package across on to Ronâs bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by houseelves in the night.\n","\n","âCheers,â said Ron drowsily, and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed, opened his own crunk and began rummaging in it for the Marauderâs Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolledup socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.\n","\n","âRight,â he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, âI solemnly swear that I am up to no good,â so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.\n","\n","âNice one, Harry!â said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeperâs gloves Harry had given him.\n","\n","âNo problem,â said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. âHey â¦ I donât think heâs in his bed â¦â\n","\n","Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.\n","\n","âSeriously good haul this year!â he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. âSee what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think Iâll come of age next year too â¦\n","\n","âCool,â muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast â¦ he was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study â¦ he wasnât in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing â¦\n","\n","âWant one? 1 said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.\n","\n","âNo thanks,â said Harry, looking up. âMalfoyâs gone again!â\n","\n","âCanât have done,â said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. âCome on. if you donât hurry up youâll have to Apparate on an emptystomach â¦ might make it easier, 1 suppose â¦â\n","\n","Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.\n","\n","Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, âMischief managed,â though it hadnât been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoyâs periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea; he had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon,\n","\n","âReady?â he said to Ron.\n","\n","He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rainwashed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face.\n","\n","âRon? Breakfast.â\n","\n","âIâm not hungry,â\n","\n","Harry stared ai him.\n","\n","âI thought you just said -?â\n","\n","-Well, all right, Iâll come down with you,â sighed Ron, âbut I donât want to eat.â\n","\n","Harry scrutinised him suspiciously.\n","\n","âYouâve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, havenât you?â\n","\n","âItâs not that,â Ron sighed again. âYou â¦ you wouldnât understand.â\n","\n","âFair enough,â said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.\n","\n","âHarry!â said Ron suddenly.\n","\n","âWhat?â\n","\n","âHarry, I canât stand it!â\n","\n","âYou canât stand what?â asked Harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.\n","\n","âI canât stop thinking about her!â said Ron hoarsely.\n","\n","Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender âLavLavâ, he would have to pui his foot down.\n","\n","âWhy does that stop you having breakfast?â Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.\n","\n","âI donât think she knows I exist,â said Ron with a desperate gesture.\n","\n","âShe definitely knows you exist,â said Harry, bewildered. âShe keeps snogging you, doesnât she?â\n","\n","Ron blinked.\n","\n","âWho are you talking about?â\n","\n","Who are you talking about?â said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.\n","\n","âRomilda Vane,â said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight. They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, âThis is a joke, right? Youâre joking.â\n","\n","T think â¦ Harry, 1 ihink I love her,â said Ron in a strangled voice.\n","\n","âOK,â said Harry, walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, âOK â¦ say that again with a straight face.â\n","\n","âI love her,â repeated Ron breathlessly. âHave you seen her hair, itâs all black and shiny and silky â¦ and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her -â\n","\n","âThis is really funny and everything,â said Harry impatiently, âbut jokeâs over, all right? Drop it.â\n","\n","He turned to leave; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked round. Ronâs fist was drawn right back, his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.\n","\n","Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Le\\icorpus!\n","\n","Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more; he dangled helplessly, upsidedown, his robes hanging off him.\n","\n","âWhat was that for?â Harry bellowed.\n","\n","âYou insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!â shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.\n","\n","âThis is insane!â said Harry. âWhatâs got into -?â\n","\n","And then he saw the box lying open on Ronâs bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.\n","\n","âWhere did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?â\n","\n","âThey were a birthday present!â shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. â1 offered you one, didnât 1?â\n","\n","âYou just picked them up off the floor, didnât you?â\n","\n","âTheyâd fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!â\n","\n","âThey didnât fall off your bed, you prat, donât you understand? They were mine, 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map. Theyâre the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and theyâre all spiked with love potion!â\n","\n","But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.\n","\n","âRomilda?â he repeated. âDid you say Romilda? Harry - do you know her? Can you introduce me?â\n","\n","Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off â¦ but on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.\n","\n","âYeah, Iâll introduce you,â said Harry, thinking fast. âIâm going to let you down now, OK?â\n","\n","He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.\n","\n","âSheâll be in Slughornâs office, 1 said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.\n","\n","âWhy will she be in there?â asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.\n","\n","âOh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,â said Harry, inventing wildly.\n","\n","âMaybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her?â said Ron eagerly.\n","\n","âGreat idea,â said Harry. Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen.\n","\n","âYouâre lace, WonWon!â she pouted. âIâve got you a birthday-â\n","\n","âLeave me alone,â said Ron impatiently, âHarryâs going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.â\n","\n","And without another word to her, he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.\n","\n","Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressinggown and matching nightcap and looking rather blearyeyed.\n","\n","âHarry,â he mumbled. âThis is very early for a call â¦ I generally sleep late on a Saturday â¦â\n","\n","âProfessor, Iâm really sorry to disturb you,â said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, âbut my friend Ronâs swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldnât make him an antidote, could you? Iâd take him to Madam Pomfrey, but weâre not supposed to have anything from Weasleysâ Wizard Wheezes and, you know â¦ awkward questions â¦â\n","\n","Td have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?â asked Slughorn. âEr,â said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, âwell, Iâve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right Ron mightâve done something serious -â\n","\n","Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, âI canât see her. Harry - is he hiding her?â\n","\n","âWas this potion within date?â asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. âThey can strengthen, you know, the longer theyâre kept.â\n","\n","That would explain a lot,â panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. âItâs his birthday, Professor,â he added imploringly.\n","\n","âOh, all right, come in, then, come in,â said Slughorn, relenting. âIâve got the necessary here in my bag, itâs not a difficult antidote â¦â\n","\n","Ron burst through the door into Slughornâs overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasselled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered, âShe didnât see that, did she?â\n","\n","âSheâs not here yet,â said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.\n","\n","Thatâs good,â said Ron fervently. âHow do I look?â\n","\n","âVery handsome,â said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. âNow drink that up, itâs a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know,â\n","\n","âBrilliant,â said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.\n","\n","Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.\n","\n","âBack to normal, then?â said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. Thanks a lot, Professor.â\n","\n","âDonât mention it, mâboy, donât mention it,â said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. âPickmeup, thatâs what he needs,â Slughorn continued, nowbustling over to a table loaded with drinks. âIâve got Butterbeer, Iâve got wine, Iâve got one last bottle of this oakmatured mead â¦ hmm â¦ meant to give that to Dumbledore for\n","\n","Christmas â¦ ah well â¦â he shrugged ââ¦ he canât miss what heâs never had! Why donât we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasleyâs birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love â¦â\n","\n","He chortled again and Harry joined in. This was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood â¦ perhaps if they got through enough of the oakmatured mead â¦\n","\n","There you are, then,â said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each, before raising his own. âWell, a very happy birthday, Ralph -â\n","\n","â- Ron -â whispered Harry.\n","\n","But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.\n","\n","There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.\n","\n","â- and may you have many more -\n","\n","âRon!â\n","\n","Ron had dropped his glass; he halfrose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.\n","\n","âProfessor!â Harry bellowed. âDo something]â\n","\n","But Slughorn seemed paralysed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: his skin was turning blue.\n","\n","âWhat - but -â spluttered Slughorn.\n","\n","Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards Slughornâs open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ronâs gargling breath filled the room. Then\n","\n","he found it - the shrivelled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.\n","\n","He hurtled back to Ronâs side, wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 19: Elf Tails\n","\n","\n","So, all in all, not one of Ronâs better birthdays?â said Fred.\n","\n","It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ronâs was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight oâclock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.\n","\n","âThis isnât how we imagined handing over our present,â said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ronâs bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.\n","\n","âYeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,â said Fred.\n","\n","âThere we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him ââ said George.\n","\n","âYou were in Hogsmeade?â asked Ginny, looking up.\n","\n","âWe were thinking of buying Zonkoâs,â said Fred gloomily. âA Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good itâll do us if you lot arenât allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymon â¦ But never mind that now.â\n","\n","He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ronâs pale face.\n","\n","âHow exactly did it happen, Harry?â\n","\n","Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.\n","\n","â. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon heâll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says heâll have to stay here a week or so â¦ keep taking essence of rue . . .â\n","\n","âBlimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,â said George in a low voice.\n","\n","âLucky there was one in the room,â said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.\n","\n","Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, whitefaced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened., she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginnyâs obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clenchjawed and frightenedlooking, until ai last they had been allowed in to see him.\n","\n","âDo Mum and Dad know?â Fred asked Ginny. âTheyâve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago â theyâre in Dumbledoreâs office now, but theyâll be back soon. . . .â\n","\n","There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.\n","\n","âSo the poison was in the drink?â said Fred quietly.\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. âSlughorn poured it out ââ\n","\n","âWould he have been able to slip something into Ronâs glass without you seeing?â\n","\n","âProbably,â said Harry, âbut why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?â\n","\n","âNo idea,â said Fred, frowning. âYou donât think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?â\n","\n","âWhy would Slughorn want to poison Harry?â asked Ginny. âI dunno,â said Fred, âbut there must be loads of people whoâd like to poison Harry, mustnât there? âThe Chosen Oneâ and all that?â âSo you think Slughornâs a Death Eater?â said Ginny. :,\n","\n","âAnythingâs possible,â said Fred darkly. âHe could be under the Imperius Curse,â said George. âOr he could be innocent,â said Ginny. âThe poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.â\n","\n","âWhoâd want to kill Slughorn?â\n","\n","âDumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,â said Harry. âSlughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And . . .â He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn. âAnd maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âBut you said Slughorn had been planning to give th.u Untie to Dumbledore for Christmas,â Ginny reminded him. âSo the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âThen the poisoner didnât know Slughorn very well,â said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. âAnyone who knew Slughorn would have I known there was a good chance heâd keep something that tasty for himself.â I\n","\n","âErmynee,â croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them\n","\n","They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.\n","\n","The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair rainflecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphinsized footprints all over the floor.\n","\n","âBin in the forest all day!â he panted. âAragogâs worse, I bin readinâ to him â didnâ get up ter dinner till jusâ now anâ then Professor Sprout told me abouâ Ron! How is he?â\n","\n","âNot bad,â said Harry. âThey say heâll be okay.â\n","\n","âNo more than six visitors at a time!â said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office.\n","\n","âHagrid makes six,â George pointed out.\n","\n","âOh . . . yes. ..â said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand.\n","\n","âI donâ believe this,â said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. âJusâ donâ believe itâ¦ Look at him lyinâ there. . . . Whoâd want ter hurt him, eh?â\n","\n","âThatâs just what we were discussing,â said Harry. âWe donât know.â\n","\n","âSomeone couldnâ have a grudge against the Gryfinndor Quidditch team, could they?â said Hagrid anxiously. âFirsâ Katie, now Ron . . .â\n","\n","âI cant see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,â said\n","\n","I m urge.\n","\n","Wood mightâve done the Slytherins if he couldâve got away with it,â said Fred fairly.\n","\n","Well, I donât think itâs Quidditch, but I think thereâs a connection between the attacks,â said Hermione quietly\n","\n","âHow dâyou work that out?â asked Fred.\n","\n","âWell, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and werenât, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was (supposed to be killed. Of course,â she added broodingly, âthat makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they donât seem to care how many people they finish off In lore they actually reach their victim.â\n","\n","Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, tin- dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tighty. âDumbledoreâs told us how you saved him with the bezoar,â she sobbed. âOh, Harry, what can we say? You saved Ginny . . . you saved Arthur , . . now youâve saved Ron\n","\n","âDonât be â¦ I didnât. . .â muttered Harry awkwardly. âHalf our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,â Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. âWell, all I can say is that it was a lucky clay for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Expirv., Harry.â\n","\n","Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost gl.iÂ«l when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ronâs bed; he and Hermione rose .h once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.\n","\n","âItâs terrible,â growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three ol them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. âMl this new security, an kids are still gettinâ hurt. . . . Dumbledoivâs worried sick. . . . He don say much, but I can tell. . . .â\n","\n","âHasnât he got any ideas, Hagrid?â asked Hermione desperately.\n","\n","âI spect heâs got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,â said Hagrid. âBut he doesnâ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or theyâdve bin caught, wouldn they? Whaâ worries me,â said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Peeves), âis how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are beinâ attacked. Chamber oâ Secrets all over again, isnâ it? Thereâll be panic, more parents takin their kids outta school, an nexâ thing yeh know the board oâ governors â¦â\n","\n","Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a longhaired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, â. . . the board oâ governorsâll be talkin about shuttinâ us up fer good.â\n","\n","âSurely not?â said Hermione, looking worried.\n","\n","âGotta see it from their point oâ view,â said Hagrid heavily. âI mean, itâs always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasnâ it? Yer expect accidents, donâ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, thaâs tliffârent. âSâno wonder Dumbledoreâs angry with Sn ââ\n","\n","Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.\n","\n","âWhat?â said Harry quickly. âDumbledoreâs angry with Snape?â\n","\n","âI never said thaâ,â said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. âLook at the time, itâs gettinâ on fer midnight, I need ter ââ\n","\n","âHagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?â Harry asked loudly.\n","\n","âShhhh!â said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. âDonâ shout stuff like that, Harry, dâyeh wanâ me ter lose me job? Mind, I donâ suppose yehâd care, would yeh, not now yehâve given up Care of Magââ\n","\n","âDonât try and make me feel guilty, it wont work!â said Harry forcefully. âWhatâs Snape done?â\n","\n","âI dunno, Harry, I shouldnâta heard it at all! I â well, I was cominâ outta the forest the other eveninâ anâ I overheard âem talkingâ well, arguinâ. Didnât like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen, but it was a â well, a heated discussion anâ it wasnâ easy ter block it out.â\n","\n","âWell?â Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.\n","\n","âWell â I jusâ heard Snape sayinâ Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he â Snape â didnâ wanâ ter do it any more ââ\n","\n","âDo what?â\n","\n","âI dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelinâ a bit overworked, thaâs all â anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out heâd agreed ter do it anâ that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. Anâ then he said summat abouâ Snape makinâ investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, thereâs nothinâ strange abouâ that!â Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. âAll the Heads oâ Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business ââ\n","\n","âYeah, but Dumbledoreâs not having rows with the rest of them, is he?â said Harry.\n","\n","âLook,â Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. âI know what yehâre like abouâ Snape, Harry, anâ I donâ want yeh ter go readinâ more inter this than there is.â\n","\n","âLook out,â said Hermione tersely.\n","\n","They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.\n","\n","âOho!â he wheezed. âOut of bed so late, thisâll mean detention!â\n","\n","âNo it wonâ, Filch,â said Hagrid shortly. âTheyâre with me, arenâ they?â\n","\n","âAnd what difference does that make?â asked Filch obnoxiously.\n","\n","âIâm a ruddy teacher, arenâ I, yeh sneakinâ Squib!â said Hagrid, firing up at once.\n","\n","There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filchâs skinny ankles.\n","\n","âGet goin,â said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.\n","\n","Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagridâs and Filchâs raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,\n","\n","When thereâs strife and when thereâs trouble\n","\n","Call on Peevsie, heâll make double!\n","\n","The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girlsâ dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.\n","\n","So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins â¦ or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?\n","\n","Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harryâs suspicions? That seemed likely. It , might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteenyearolds. â¦\n","\n","âThere you are, Potter!â\n","\n","Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.\n","\n","âIâve been waiting for you to come back,â said McLaggen, disregarding Harryâs drawn wand. âMustâve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didnât look like heâll be fit for next weekâs match.â\n","\n","It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.\n","\n","âOh . . . right. . . Quidditch,â he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. âYeah â¦ he might not make it.â\n","\n","âWell, then, Iâll be playing Keeper, wonât I?â said McLaggen.\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry. âYeah, I suppose so. â¦â\n","\n","He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed secondbest in the trials.\n","\n","âExcellent,â said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. âSo whenâs practice?â\n","\n","âWhat? Oh . . . thereâs one tomorrow evening.â\n","\n","âGood. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. Iâve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry unenthusiastically. âWell, Iâll hear them tomorrow, then. Iâm pretty tired now â¦ see you . . .â\n","\n","The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katieâs attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions masterâs room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\n","\n","Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauderâs Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .\n","\n","But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.\n","\n","He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.\n","\n","Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggenâs Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing â âI mean, I am his girlfriend!â â but unfortunately slithad now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of indepth chats with him about Ronâs feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.\n","\n","âLook, why donât you talk to Ron about all this?â Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new drew robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be âserious.â\n","\n","âWell, I would, but heâs always asleep when I go and see him!â said Lavender fretfully.\n","\n","âIs he?â said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snapeâs row and keen m abuse McLaggen as much as possible.\n","\n","âIs Hermione Granger still visiting him?â Lavender demanded suddenly.\n","\n","âYeah, I think so. Well, theyâre friends, arenât they?â said Harry uncomfortably.\n","\n","âFriends, donât make me laugh,â said Lavender scornfully. âShe didnât talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now heâs all interesting. â¦â\n","\n","âWould you call getting poisoned being interesting?â asked Harry. âAnyway â sorry, got to go â thereâs McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,â said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.\n","\n","On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.\n","\n","âSo howâs McLaggen shaping up?â he asked Harry nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.\n","\n","âIâve told you,â said Harry patiently, âhe could be worldclass and I wouldnât want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I canât wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,â Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, âwill you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? Sheâs driving me mad as well.â\n","\n","âOh,â said Ron, looking sheepish. âYeah. All right.â\n","\n","âIf you donât want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,â said Harry.\n","\n","âYeah . . . well. . . itâs not that easy, is it?â said Ron. He paused. âHermione going to look in before the match?â he added casually.\n","\n","âNo, sheâs already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.â\n","\n","âOh,â said Ron, looking rather glum. âRight. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag â I mean, Smith.â\n","\n","âIâll try,â said Harry, shouldering his broom. âSee you after the match.â\n","\n","He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful.\n","\n","Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.\n","\n","âWhereâre you going?â Harry demanded.\n","\n","âYeah, Iâm really going to tell you, because itâs your business, Potter,â sneered Malfoy. âYouâd better hurry up, theyâll be waiting for âthe Chosen Captainâ â âthe Boy Who Scoredâ â whatever they call you these days.â\n","\n","One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.\n","\n","Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harryâs best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished. . . .\n","\n","âWhere have you been?â demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.\n","\n","âI met Malfoy,â Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head.\n","\n","âSo I wanted to know how come heâs up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. â¦â\n","\n","âDoes it matter right now?â\n","\n","âWell, Iâm not likely to find out, am I?â said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. âCome on then!â\n","\n","And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos.\n","\n","There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.\n","\n","âTricky conditions!â McLaggen said bracingly to the team. âCoote, Peakes, youâll want to fly out of the sun, so they donât see you coming ââ\n","\n","âIâm the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,â said Harry angrily. âJust get up by the goal posts!â\n","\n","Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.\n","\n","âMake sure you do fly out of the sun,â he told them grudgingly.\n","\n","He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hoochâs whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauderâs Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .\n","\n","âAnd thatâs Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,â said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. âHe did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now heâs playing them â oh, look, heâs lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her, sheâs very nice. â¦â\n","\n","Harry stared down at the commentatorâs podium. Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirtyblonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.\n","\n","â. . . but now that big Hufflepuff playerâs got the Quaffle from , her, I canât remember his name, itâs something like Bibble â no, Buggins ââ\n","\n","âItâs Cadwallader!â said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna. The crowd laughed.\n","\n","Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.\n","\n","âMcLaggen, will you pay attention to what youâre supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!â bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.\n","\n","âYouâre not setting a great example!â McLaggen shouted back, redfaced and furious.\n","\n","âAnd Harry Potterâs now having an argument with his Keeper,â said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. âI donât think thatâll help him find the Snitch, but maybe itâs a clever ruse. â¦â\n","\n","Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.\n","\n","Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the redandgoldclad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowdâs attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called âLoserâs Lurgy.â\n","\n","âSeventyforty to Hufflepuff!â barked Professor McGonagall into Lunaâs megaphone.\n","\n","âIs it, already?â said Luna vaguely. âOh, look! The Gryffindor Keeperâs got hold of one of the Beaterâs bats.â\n","\n","Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakesâs bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.\n","\n","âWill you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!â roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.\n","\n","A blinding, sickening pain â¦ a flash of light. . . distant screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel. . .\n","\n","And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiarlooking, freckly, redhaired person.\n","\n","âNice of you to drop in,â said Ron, grinning.\n","\n","Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago â¦ as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harryâs head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.\n","\n","âWhat happened?â\n","\n","âCracked skull,â said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. âNothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but Iâm keeping you in overnight. You shouldnât over exert yourself for a few hours.â\n","\n","âI donât want to stay here overnight,â said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. âI want to find McLaggen and kill him.â\n","\n","âIâm afraid that would come under the heading of âoverexertion,ââ said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. âYou will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.â\n","\n","She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.\n","\n","âDâyou know how much we lost by?â he asked Ron through clenched teeth.\n","\n","âWell, yeah I do,â said Ron apologetically. âFinal score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.â\n","\n","âBrilliant,â said Harry savagely. âReally brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen ââ\n","\n","âYou donât want to get hold of him, heâs the size of a troll,â said\n","\n","Ron reasonably. âPersonally, I think thereâs a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Princeâs. Anyway, the rest of the team mightâve dealt with him before you get out of here, theyâre not happy. â¦â\n","\n","There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.\n","\n","âI could hear the match commentary from here,â said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. âI hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . . Loserâs Lurgy â¦â\n","\n","But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ronâs snorts subsided.\n","\n","âGinny came in to visit while you were unconscious,â he said, after a long pause, and Harryâs imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. . . .âShe reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.â\n","\n","âOh . . .â said Harry, as the scene in his mindâs eye imploded. âYeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didnât look like they wanted to be with him, and thatâs the second time heâs made sure he isnât down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?â Harry sighed. âWish Iâd followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . .â\n","\n","âDonât be stupid,â said Ron sharply. âYou couldnât have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, youâre the Captain!â\n","\n","âI want to know what heâs up to,â said Harry. âAnd donât tell nn its all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape ââ\n","\n","âI never said it was all in your head,â said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, âbut thereâs no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! Youâre getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him â¦â\n","\n","âI want to catch him at it!â said Harry in frustration. âI mean, whereâs he going when he disappears off the map?â\n","\n","âI dunno . . . Hogsmeade?â suggested Ron, yawning.\n","\n","âIâve never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?â\n","\n","âWell then, I dunno,â said Ron.\n","\n","Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamp light above him, thinking. . . .\n","\n","If only he had Rufus Scrimgeourâs power, he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .\n","\n","There was a low, rumbling snore from Ronâs bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed.\n","\n","This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart. . . . That had been his most painful injury by far â¦ he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the â\n","\n","Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed â how could he have forgotten, why hadnât he thought\n","\n","of it before?\n","\n","But the question was, how to call him? What did you do? Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.\n","\n","âKreacher?â\n","\n","There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.\n","\n","âWhatâs going â ?â\n","\n","Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfreyâs office and muttered, âMuffliato!â so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at\n","\n","what was going on.\n","\n","Two houseelves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.\n","\n","âI was watching that, Potty!â he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. âLook at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy ââ\n","\n","âKreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he wonât, or Dobby will shut Kreacherâs mouth for him!â cried Dobby in a highpitched voice.\n","\n","ââ kicky, scratchy!â cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits ofâ chalk at the elves to enrage them further. âTweaky, pokey!â\n","\n","âKreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacherâs mistress say â ?â\n","\n","Exactly what Kreacherâs mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacherâs mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, âStick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies ââ\n","\n","Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, âLanglock!â Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.\n","\n","âNice one,â said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. âThat was another Prince hex, wasnât it?â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry, twisting Kreacherâs wizened arm into a half nelson. âRight â Iâm forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, youâre forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know Iâm not allowed to give you orders ââ\n","\n","âDobby is a free houseelf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!â said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.\n","\n","âOkay then,â said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.\n","\n","âMaster called me?â croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.\n","\n","âYeah, I did,â said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfreyâs office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. âIâve got a job for you.â\n","\n","âKreacher will do whatever Master wants,â said Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, âbecause Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes ââ\n","\n","âDobby will do it, Harry Potter!â squeaked Dobby, his tennisballsized eyes still swimming in tears. âDobby would be honored to help Harry Potter!â\n","\n","âCome to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,â said Harry. âOkay then â¦ I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.â\n","\n","Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ronâs face, Harry went on, âI want to know where heâs going, who heâs meeting, and what heâs doing. I want you to follow him around the clock.â\n","\n","âYes, Harry Potter!â said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement. âAnd if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!â\n","\n","âThere wonât be any need for that,â said Harry hastily.\n","\n","âMaster wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?â croaked Kreacher. âMaster wants me to spy upon the pureblood greatnephew of my old mistress?â\n","\n","âThatâs the one,â said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. âAnd youâre forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what youâre up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or â¦ or to contact him in any way. Got it?â\n","\n","He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harrys great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, âMaster thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes. . . .â\n","\n","âThatâs settled, then,â said Harry. âIâll want regular reports, but make sure Iâm not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And donât tell anyone what youâre doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 20: Lord Voldemortâs Request\n","\n","\n","Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harryâs chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.\n","\n","âWhat did they row about?â he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventhfloor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying.\n","\n","âItâs all right!â said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. âHere â¦â\n","\n","She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, âReparo.â The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.\n","\n","âI swear theyâre getting smaller,â he said.\n","\n","âNever mind her,â said Harry, a little impatiently. âWhat did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?â\n","\n","âOh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludgu at you,â said Hermione.\n","\n","âIt mustâve looked funny,â said Ron reasonably. âIt didnât look funny at all!â said Hermione hotly. âIt looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadnât caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!â\n","\n","âYeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,â said Harry, still trying to sound casual. âOr are they still together?â\n","\n","âYes, they are â but why are you so interested?â asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look.\n","\n","âI just donât want my Quidditch team messed up again!â he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, âHarry!â giving him an excuse to turn his back on her. âOh, hi, Luna.â\n","\n","- âI went to the hospital wing to find you,â said Luna, rummaging in her bag. âBut they said youâd leftâ¦â\n","\n","She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ronâs hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry.\n","\n","â. . . Iâve been told to give you this.â\n","\n","It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.\n","\n","âTonight,â he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.\n","\n","âNice commentary last match!â said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.\n","\n","âYouâre making fun of me, arenât you?â she said. âEveryone says I was dreadful.â\n","\n","âNo, Iâm serious!â said Ron earnestly. âI canât remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?â he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level.\n","\n","âOh, itâs a Gurdyroot,â she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. âYou can keep it if you like, Iâve got a few of them. Theyâre really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.â And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.\n","\n","âYou know, sheâs grown on me, Luna,â he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. âI know sheâs insane, but itâs in a good ââ He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous. âHi,â said Ron nervously.\n","\n","âCâmon,â Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, âWhy didnât you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?â\n","\n","Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harryâs Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.\n","\n","âThanks a lot, Hermione,â said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight oâclock. âListen, Iâve got to hurry or Iâll be late for Dumbledore. â¦â\n","\n","She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.\n","\n","âEnter,â called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.\n","\n","âAha!â she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles.\n","\n","âSo this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!â\n","\n","âMy dear Sybill,â said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, âthere is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really donât think there is any more to be said ââ\n","\n","âVery well,â said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. âIf you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. â¦\n","\n","Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. â¦â\n","\n","She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.\n","\n","âPlease close the door and sit down, Harry,â said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired.\n","\n","Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledoreâs desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.\n","\n","âProfessor Trelawney still isnât happy Firenze is teaching, then?â Harry asked.\n","\n","âNo,â said Dumbledore, âDivination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know â and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her â that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.â\n","\n","Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, âBut never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly â have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?â\n","\n","âAh,â said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. âWell, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldnât give it to me.â There was a little silence.\n","\n","âI see,â said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being Xrayed. âAnd you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?â\n","\n","âWell,â Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. âWell . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood ââ âAnd did that work?â asked Dumbledore. âWell, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned ââ ââ which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.â\n","\n","A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harryâs head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.\n","\n","âSir,â he said, a little desperately, âit isnât that I wasnât bothered or anything, Iâve just had other â other things . . .â\n","\n","âOther things on your mind,â Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. âI see.â\n","\n","Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledoreâs head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, âProfessor Dumbledore, Iâm really sorry. I should have done more. â¦ I should have realized you wouldnât have asked me to do it if it wasnât really important.â\n","\n","âThank you for saying that, Harry,â said Dumbledore quietly. âMay I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.â\n","\n","âIâll do it, sir, Iâll get it from him,â he said earnestly.\n","\n","âThen we shall say no more about it just now,â said Dumbledore more kindly, âbut continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?â\n","\n","âYes, sir,â said Harry quickly. âVoldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked â¦ he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes,â he mumbled shamefacedly.\n","\n","âVery good,â said Dumbledore. âNow, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?â\n","\n","âYes, sirâ.\n","\n","âThus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?â\n","\n","Harry nodded.\n","\n","âBut now, Harry,â said Dumbledore, ânow things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.â Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. âI shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.â\n","\n","The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.\n","\n","âI hope you are not tired of diving into other peopleâs memories, for they are curious recollections, these two,â he said. âThis first one came from a very old houseelf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts.\n","\n","âHe reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.â\n","\n","âAt Borgin and Burkes?â Harry repeated, stunned.\n","\n","âAt Borgin and Burkes,â repeated Dumbledore calmly. âI think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokeyâs memory. But this was not Voldemortâs first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time â I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided â but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.â\n","\n","âHe wanted to stay here? Why?â asked Harry, more amazed still.\n","\n","âI believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,â said Dumbledore. âFirstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.â\n","\n","Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too.\n","\n","âSecondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.\n","\n","âAnd thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.â\n","\n","âBut he didnât get the job, sir?â\n","\n","âNo, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach.â\n","\n","âHow did you feel about that, sir?â asked Harry hesitantly. âDeeply uneasy,â said Dumbledore. âI had advised Armando against the appointment â I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power.â\n","\n","âWhich job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?â\n","\n","Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.\n","\n","âDefense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.\n","\n","âSo Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.â\n","\n","âIâll bet he was,â said Harry, unable to contain himself.\n","\n","âWell, quite,â said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. âAnd now it is time to hear from Hokey the houseelf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.â\n","\n","Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, âAfter you, Harry.â\n","\n","Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest houseelf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.\n","\n","âHurry up, Hokey!â said Hepzibah imperiously. âHe said heâd come at four, itâs only a couple of minutes to and heâs never been late yet!â\n","\n","She tucked away her powder puff as the houseelf straightened up. The top of the elfâs head barely reached the seat of Hepzibahâs chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.\n","\n","âHow do I look?â said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror.\n","\n","âLovely, madam,â squeaked Hokey.\n","\n","Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokeyâs contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.\n","\n","A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.\n","\n","âQuick, quick, heâs here, Hokey!â cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of goldembossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.\n","\n","The houseelf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibahâs fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.\n","\n","âI brought you flowers,â he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.\n","\n","âYou naughty boy, you shouldnât have!â squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. âYou do spoil this old lady, Tom. â¦ Sit down, sit down. . . . Whereâs Hokey? Ah â¦â\n","\n","The houseelf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistressâs elbow.\n","\n","âHelp yourself, Tom,â said Hepzibah, âI know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, Iâve said it a hundred times. â¦â\n","\n","Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.\n","\n","âWell, whatâs your excuse for visiting this time?â she asked, batring her lashes.\n","\n","âMr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblinmade armor,â said Voldemort. âFive hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair ââ\n","\n","âNow, now, not so fast, or Iâll think youâre only here for my trinkets!â pouted Hepzibah.\n","\n","âI am ordered here because of them,â said Voldemort quietly. âI am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire ââ\n","\n","âOh, Mr. Burke, phooey!â said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. âIâve something to show you that Iâve never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you wonât tell Mr. Burke Iâve got it? Heâd never let me rest if he knew Iâd shown it to you, and Iâm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, youâll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.â\n","\n","âIâd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,â said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.\n","\n","âI had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. â¦ In fact, bring both, while youâre at it. â¦â\n","\n","âHere, madam,â squeaked the houseelf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools.\n","\n","âNow,â said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, âI think youâll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They canât wait to get their hands on this!â\n","\n","She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.\n","\n","âI wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!â whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a longfingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibahâs face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemortâs handsome features.\n","\n","âA badger,â murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. âThen this was . . . ?â\n","\n","âHelga Hufflepuffâs, as you very well know, you clever boy!â said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. âDidnât I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isnât it? And all sorts of powers itâs supposed to possess too, but I havenât tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .â\n","\n","She hooked the cup back off Voldemortâs long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemortâs face as the cup was taken away.\n","\n","âNow then,â said Hepzibah happily, âwhereâs Hokey? Oh yes, there you are â take that away now, Hokey.â\n","\n","The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.\n","\n","âI think youâll like this even more, Tom,â she whispered. âLean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows Iâve got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay heâd love to get it back when Iâm gone. â¦â\n","\n","She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.\n","\n","Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.\n","\n","âSlytherinâs mark,â he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.\n","\n","âThatâs right!â said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. âI had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldnât let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a raggedlooking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value ââ\n","\n","There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemortâs eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locketâs chain.\n","\n","ââ I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isnât it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . .â\n","\n","She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.\n","\n","âSo there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!â\n","\n","She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter.\n","\n","âAre you all right, dear?â\n","\n","âOh yes,â said Voldemort quietly. âYes, Iâm very well. â¦â\n","\n","âI thought â but a trick of the light, I suppose ââ said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemortâs eyes. âHere, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again. â¦ The usual enchantmentsâ¦\n","\n","âTime to leave, Harry,â said Dumbledore quietly, and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledoreâs office.\n","\n","âHepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,â said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. âHokey the houseelf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistressâs evening cocoa by accident.â\n","\n","âNo way!â said Harry angrily.\n","\n","âI see we are of one mind,â said Dumbledore. âCertainly, then are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death ââ âHokey confessed?â\n","\n","âShe remembered putting something in her mistressâs cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and littleknown poison, said Dumbledore. âIt was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused ââ\n","\n","âVoldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!â âYes, that is my conclusion too,â said Dumbledore. âAnd, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey ââ\n","\n","ââ because she was a houseelf,â said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W. âPrecisely,â said Dumbledore. âShe was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over â but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.\n","\n","âBy the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibahâs family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time.\n","\n","âNow,â said Dumbledore, âif you donât mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfinâs ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket.â\n","\n","âBut,â said Harry, frowning, âit seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . .â\n","\n","âMad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,â said Dumbledore. âI hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.â âThe locket maybe,â said Harry, âbut why take the cup as well?â\n","\n","âIt had belonged to another of Hogwartsâs founders,â said Dumbledore. âI think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. â¦ I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.\n","\n","âAnd now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughornâs memory for us. Ten years separates Hokeyâs memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .â Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.\n","\n","âWhose memory is it?â he asked. âMine,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the presentday office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.\n","\n","The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, âEnter.â\n","\n","Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.\n","\n","The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.\n","\n","âGood evening, Tom,â said Dumbledore easily. âWonât you sit down?â\n","\n","âThank you,â said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured â the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. âI heard that you had become headmaster,â he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. âA worthy choice.â\n","\n","âI am glad you approve,â said Dumbledore, smiling. âMay I offer you a drink?â\n","\n","âThat would be welcome,â said Voldemort. âI have come a long way.â\n","\n","Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk. . âSo, Tom â¦ to what do I owe the pleasure?â\n","\n","Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.\n","\n","âThey do not call me âTomâ anymore,â he said. âThese days, 1 am known as ââ\n","\n","âI know what you are known as,â said Dumbledore, smiling, pleasantly. âBut to me, Iâm afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their chargesâ youthful beginnings.â\n","\n","He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledoreâs refusal to use Voldemortâs chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.\n","\n","âI am surprised you have remained here so long,â said Voldemort after a short pause. âI always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.â\n","\n","âWell,â said Dumbledore, still smiling, âto a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.â\n","\n","âI see it still,â said Voldemort. âI merely wondered why you â who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister ââ\n","\n","âThree times at the last count, actually,â said Dumbledore. âBut the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.â\n","\n","Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.\n","\n","âI have returned,â he said, after a little while, âlater, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.â\n","\n","Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.\n","\n","âYes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,â he said quietly. âRumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.â\n","\n","Voldemortâs expression remained impassive as he said, âGreatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âYou call it âgreatness,â what you have been doing, do you?â asked Dumbledore delicately.\n","\n","âCertainly,â said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. âI have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed ââ\n","\n","âOf some kinds of magic,â Dumbledore corrected him quietly. âOf some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.â\n","\n","For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.\n","\n","âThe old argument,â he said softly. âBut nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âPerhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,â suggested Dumbledore.\n","\n","âWell, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?â said Voldemort. âWill you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.â\n","\n","Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. âAnd what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves â or so rumor has it â the Death Eaters?â\n","\n","Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemortâs eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.\n","\n","âMy friends,â he said, after a momentâs pause, âwill carry on without me, I am sure.â\n","\n","âI am glad to hear that you consider them friends,â said Dumbledore. âI was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.â\n","\n","âYou are mistaken,â said Voldemort.\n","\n","âThen if I were to go to the Hogâs Head tonight, I would not find a group of them â Nott, Rosier, Muldber, Dolohov â awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.â\n","\n","There could be no doubt that Dumbledoreâs detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once.\n","\n","âYou are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âOh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,â said Dumbledore lightly. âNow, Tom . . .â\n","\n","Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.\n","\n","âLet us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?â\n","\n","Voldemort looked coldly surprised. âA job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.â\n","\n","âOh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it youâre after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?â\n","\n","Voldemort sneered. âIf you do not want to give me a job ââ\n","\n","âOf course I donât,â said Dumbledore. âAnd I donât think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.â\n","\n","Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage. âThis is your final word?â\n","\n","âIt is,â said Dumbledore, also standing.\n","\n","âThen we have nothing more to say to each other.â\n","\n","âNo, nothing,â said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. âThe time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. â¦ I wish I could. . . .â\n","\n","For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemortâs hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.\n","\n","Harry felt Dumbledoreâs hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledoreâs hand was blackened and deadlooking once more.\n","\n","âWhy?â said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledoreâs face. âWhy did he come back? Did you ever find out?â\n","\n","âI have ideas,â said Dumbledore, âbut no more than that.â\n","\n","âWhat ideas, sir?â\n","\n","âI shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âWhen you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear â¦ to both of us.â\n","\n","Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.\n","\n","âWas he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didnât say. â¦â\n","\n","âOh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,â said Dumbledore. âThe aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 21: The Unknowable Room\n","\n","\n","Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.\n","\n","âYou wonât find anything in there,â said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening.\n","\n","âDonât start, Hermione,â said Harry. âIf it hadnât been for the Prince, Ron wouldnât be sitting here now.â\n","\n","âHe would if youâd just listened to Snape in our first year,â said Hermione dismissively.\n","\n","Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation âSectumsempra!â scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words âFor enemies,â and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twentyfirst of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.\n","\n","Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.\n","\n","âAt least you can Apparate, though!â said Ron tensely. âYouâll have no trouble come July!â\n","\n","âIâve only done it once,â Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.\n","\n","Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now.\n","\n","âIâm telling you, the stupid Prince isnât going to be able to help you with this, Harry!â said Hermione, more loudly. âThereâs only one way to force someone to do what you want, and thatâs the Imperius Curse, which is illegal ââ\n","\n","âYeah, I know that, thanks,â said Harry, not looking up from the book. âThatâs why Iâm looking for something different. Dumbledorf says Veritaserum wonât do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . .â\n","\n","âYouâre going about it the wrong way,â said Hermione. âOnly you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people canât. Itâs not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that ââ\n","\n","âHow do you spell âbelligerentâ?â said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. âIt canât be B â U â M ââ\n","\n","âNo, it isnât,â said Hermione, pulling Ronâs essay toward her. âAnd âauguryâ doesnât begin O â R â G either. What kind of quill are you using?â\n","\n","âItâs one of Fred and Georgeâs SpellCheck ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off.â\n","\n","âYes, it must,â said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, âbecause we were asked how weâd deal with dementors, not âDugbogsâ, and I donât remember you changing your name to âRoonil Wazlibâ either.â\n","\n","âAh no!â said Ron, staring horrorstruck at the parchment. âDonât say Iâll have to write the whole thing out again!â\n","\n","âItâs okay, we can fix it,â said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.\n","\n","âI love you, Hermione,â said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, âDonât let Lavender hear you saying that.â\n","\n","â1 wonât,â said Ron into his hands. âOr maybe I will, then sheâll ditch me.â\n","\n","âWhy donât you ditch her if you want to finish it?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âYou havenât ever chucked anyone, have you?â said Ron. âYou and Cho just ââ\n","\n","âSort of fell apart, yeah,â said Harry.\n","\n","âWish that would happen with me and Lavender,â said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. âBut the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. Itâs like going out with the giant squid.â\n","\n","âThere,â said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ronâs essay.\n","\n","âThanks a million,â said Ron. âCan I borrow your quill for the conclusion?â Harry, who had found nothing useful in the HalfBlood Princeâs notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermioneâs quill. Harry had just closed the HalfBlood Princeâs book, yawning, when â\n","\n","Crack!\n","\n","Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, âKreacher!â\n","\n","The houseelf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. âMaster said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to giveââ\n","\n","Crack!\n","\n","Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his teacozy hat askew. âDobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!â he squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look. âAnd Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!â\n","\n","âWhat is this?â asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. âWhatâs going on, Harry?â Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; houseelves were always such a touchy subject with her.\n","\n","âWell. . . theyâve been following Malfoy for me,â he said.\n","\n","âNight and day,â croaked Kreacher.\n","\n","âDobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!â said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. Hermione looked indignant.\n","\n","âYou havenât slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didnât tell him not to ââ\n","\n","âNo, of course I didnât,â said Harry quickly. âDobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?â he hastened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again.\n","\n","âMaster Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,â croaked Kreacher at once. âHis features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those ofââ\n","\n","âDraco Malfoy is a bad boy!â squeaked Dobby angrily. âA bad boy who â who ââ He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.\n","\n","âThank you, Harry Potter,â he panted. âDobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters.â Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, âBut Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a houseelf!â\n","\n","âYeah, we donât need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,â Harry told Kreacher. âLetâs fast forward to where heâs actually been going.â\n","\n","Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, âMaster Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in a variety ofââ\n","\n","âDobby, you tell me,â said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. âHas he been going anywhere he shouldnât have?â\n","\n","âHarry Potter, sir,â squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, âthe Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters ââ\n","\n","âThe Room of Requirement!â said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced PotionMaking. Hermione and Ron stared at him. âThatâs where heâs been sneaking off to! Thatâs where heâs doingâ¦ whatever heâs doing! And I bet thatâs why heâs been disappearing off the map â come to think of it, Iâve never seen the Room of Requirement on there!â\n","\n","âMaybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,â said Ron.\n","\n","âI think itâll be part of the magic of the room,â said Hermione. âIf you need it to be unplottable, it will be.â\n","\n","âDobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoyâs doing?â said Harry eagerly.\n","\n","âNo, Harry Potter, that is impossible,â said Dobby.\n","\n","âNo, itâs not,â said Harry at once. âMalfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so Iâll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.â\n","\n","âBut I donât think you will, Harry,â said Hermione slowly. âMalfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didnât he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you donât know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you donât know what to ask it to transform into.â\n","\n","âThereâll be a way around that,â said Harry dismissively. âYouâve done brilliantly, Dobby.â\n","\n","âKreachers done well too,â said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, âThe Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear ââ\n","\n","âGet out of it,â Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated. âYouâd better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.â\n","\n","âThank you, Harry Potter, sir!â squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished.\n","\n","âHow good is this?â said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elffree again. âWe know where Malfoyâs going! Weâve got him cornered now!â\n","\n","âYeah, itâs great,â said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost completed essay. Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.\n","\n","âBut whatâs all this about him going up there with a variety of studentsâ?â said Hermione. âHow many people are in on it? You wouldnât think heâd trust lots of them to know what heâs doingââ\n","\n","âYeah, that is weird,â said Harry, frowning. âI heard him telling Crabbe it wasnât Crabbeâs business what he was doingâ¦ so whatâs he telling all theseâ¦ all theseâ¦â Harryâs voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. âGod, Iâve been stupid,â he said quietly. âIts obvious, isnât it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He couldâve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . .â\n","\n","âNicked what?â said Ron.\n","\n","âPolyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lessonâ¦ There arenât a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoyâ¦ itâs just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. â¦Yeah, it all fits!â said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. âTheyâre stupid enough to do what theyâre told even if he wonât tell them what heâs up to, but he doesnât want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so heâs got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other peopleâ¦ Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch â ha! Crabbe and Goyle!â\n","\n","âDo you mean to say,â said Hermione in a hushed voice, âthat that little girl whose scales I repaired â ?â\n","\n","âYeah, of course!â said Harry loudly, staring at her. âOf course! Malfoy mustâve been inside the room at the time, so she â what am I talking about? â he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to corne out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! Weâve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!â\n","\n","âHeâs got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?â guffawed Ron. âBlimeyâ¦ no wonder they donât look too happy these days. Iâm surprised they donât tell him to stuff it.â\n","\n","âWell, they wouldnât, would they, if heâs shown them his Dark Mark?â said Harry.\n","\n","âHmmmâ¦ the Dark Mark we donât know exists,â said Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ronâs dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.\n","\n","âWeâll seeâ said Harry confidently.\n","\n","âYes, we will,â Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. âBut, Harry, before you get all excited, I still donât think youâll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing whatâs there firstâ. And I donât think you should forgetâ â she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look â âthat what youâre supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.â\n","\n","Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girlsâ dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron. âWhat dâyou think?â\n","\n","âWish I could Disapparate like a houseelf,â said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. âIâd have that Apparition Test in the bag.â\n","\n","Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had-=- been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoyâs, what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A ston room? A workshop? Harrys mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snapeâ¦\n","\n","Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.\n","\n","âLook,â he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. âI havenât forgotten about Slughorn, but I havenât got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldnât I find out what Malfoyâs doing?â\n","\n","âIâve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,â said Hermione. âItâs not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirementâ â she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page â âyou should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.â\n","\n","âAnyone we know â ?â asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.\n","\n","âYes!â said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. âBut itâs all right, heâs not dead â its Mundungus, heâs been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary, and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. Oh, and how horrible, a nineyearold boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse.â\n","\n","They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snapeâs dementor essay, and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.\n","\n","Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an elevenyearold girl.\n","\n","He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirementâs door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, âI need to see what Malfoyâs doing in hereâ¦ I need to see what Malfoyâs doing in hereâ¦ I need to see what Malfoyâs doing in hereâ¦â\n","\n","Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it â but he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall. He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding.\n","\n","âOkay,â said Harry aloud. âOkayâ¦ I thought the wrong thingâ¦â He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, concentrating as hard as he could. âI need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretlyâ¦ I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretlyâ¦â After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.\n","\n","There was no door.\n","\n","âOh, come off it,â he told the wall irritably. âThat was a clear instruction. Fine.â He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more. âI need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoyâ¦â\n","\n","He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes.\n","\n","There was still no door.\n","\n","Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.\n","\n","Harry tried every variation of âI need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside youâ that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went.\n","\n","âLate again, Potter,â said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. âTen points from Gryfrindor.â Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron. Half the class were still on their feet, taking out books and organizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them.\n","\n","âBefore we start, I want your dementor essays,â said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twentyfive scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. âAnd I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page â what is it, Mr. Finnigan?â\n","\n","âSir,â said Seamus, âIâve been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius ââ\n","\n","âNo, there wasnât,â said Snape in a bored voice.\n","\n","âBut sir, I heard people talking ââ\n","\n","âIf you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the socalled Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.â\n","\n","âI thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,â muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione. âShouldnât he be upset Mundungus has been arrest ââ\n","\n","âBut Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,â said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. âLet us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.â\n","\n","The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn. âEr â well â ghosts are transparent ââ he said.\n","\n","âOh, very good,â interrupted Snape, his lip curling. âYes, it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. âGhosts are transparent.ââ\n","\n","Pansy Parkinson let out a highpitched giggle. Several other people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, âYeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, arenât they? So theyâd be solid ââ\n","\n","âA fiveyearold could have told us as much,â sneered Snape. âThe Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizardâs spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizardâs bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth, and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent. â\n","\n","âWell, what Harry said is the most useful if weâre trying to tell them apart!â said Ron. âWhen we come facetoface with one down a dark alley, weâre going to be having a look to see if its solid, arenât we, weâre not going to be asking, âExcuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?ââ There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.\n","\n","âAnother ten points from Gryffindor,â said Snape. âI would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.â\n","\n","âNo!â whispered Hermione, grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously. âThereâs no point, youâll just end up in detention again, leave it!â\n","\n","âNow open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,â said Snape, smirking a little, âand read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.â\n","\n","Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ronâs Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boysâ bathroom with Harry.\n","\n","âSnapeâs right, though, isnât he?â said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. âI dunno whether itâs worth me taking the test. I just canât get the hang of Apparition.â\n","\n","âYou might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,â said Harry reasonably. âItâll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if youâre still not â you know â as good as youâd like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summer â Myrtle, this is the boysâ bathroom!â\n","\n","The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses. âOh,â she said glumly. âItâs you two.â\n","\n","âWho were you expecting?â said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.\n","\n","âNobody,â said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. âHe said heâd come back and see me, but then you said youâd pop in and visit me tooâ â she gave Harry a reproachful look â âand I havenât seen you for months and months. Iâve learned not to expect too much from boys.â\n","\n","âI thought you lived in that girlsâ bathroom?â said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.\n","\n","âI do,â she said, with a sulky little shrug, âbut that doesnât mean I cant visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?â\n","\n","âVividly,â said Harry.\n","\n","âBut I thought he liked me,â she said plaintively. âMaybe if you two left, heâd come back again. We had lots in common. Iâm sure he felt it.â\n","\n","And she looked hopefully toward the door. âWhen you say you had lots in common,â said Ron, sounding rather amused now, âdâyou mean he lives in an Sbend too?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. âI mean heâs sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasnât got anybody to talk to, and heâs not afraid to show his feelings and cry!â\n","\n","âThereâs been a boy in here crying?â said Harry curiously. âA young boy?â\n","\n","âNever you mind!â said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. âI promised I wouldnât tell anyone, and Iâll take his secret to the ââ\n","\n","ââ not the grave, surely?â said Ron with a snort. âThe sewers, maybe.â Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron. âYouâre right,â he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, âIâll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.â\n","\n","And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.\n","\n","âYouâd do better,â said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, âto go straight to Slughornâs office and try and get that memory from him.â\n","\n","âIâve been trying!â said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.\n","\n","âHe doesnât want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell Iâve been trying to get him on his own again, and heâs not going to let it happen!â\n","\n","âWell, youâve just got to keep at it, havenât you?â\n","\n","The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.\n","\n","Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauderâs Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, âI solemnly swear that I am up to no good,â and scanned it carefully.\n","\n","As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventhfloor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering, âHelloâ¦youâre very pretty, arenât you?â\n","\n","Goyle gave a highpitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.\n","\n","Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief-=Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.\n","\n","âOUCH!â\n","\n","He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.\n","\n","âHarry?â\n","\n","He spun around, onelegged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.\n","\n","âWhatâre you doing here?â he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?\n","\n","âI came to see Dumbledore,â said Tonks. Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mousecolored hair lank.\n","\n","âHis office isnât here,â said Harry, âitâs round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle ââ\n","\n","âI know,â said Tonks. âHeâs not there. Apparently heâs gone away again.â\n","\n","âHas he?â said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. âHey â you donât know where he goes, I suppose?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Tonks.\n","\n","âWhat did you want to see him about?â\n","\n","âNothing in particular,â said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. âI just thought he might know whatâs going on. Iâve heard rumorsâ¦ people getting hurt.â\n","\n","âYeah, I know, itâs all been in the papers,â said Harry. âThat little kid trying to kill his ââ\n","\n","âThe Prophetâs often behind the times,â said Tonks, who didnât seem to be listening to him. âYou havenât had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?â\n","\n","âNo one from the Order writes to me anymore,â said Harry, ânot since Sirius ââ He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.\n","\n","âIâm sorry,â he muttered awkwardly. âI meanâ¦ I miss him, as well.â\n","\n","âWhat?â said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. âWell. Iâll see you around, Harry.â\n","\n","And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.\n","\n","He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.\n","\n","âI did it â well, kind of!â Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. âI was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshafts, but at least I moved!â\n","\n","âGood one,â said Harry. âHowâd you do, Hermione?â\n","\n","âOh, she was perfect, obviously,â said Ron, before Hermione could answer. âPerfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is â we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you shouldâve heard Twycross going on about her â Iâll be surprised if he doesnât pop the question soon ââ\n","\n","âAnd what about you?â asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. âHave you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?â\n","\n","âYep,â said Harry. âAnd guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!â\n","\n","âTonks?â repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.\n","\n","âYeah, she said sheâd come to visit Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âIf you ask me,â said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, âsheâs cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.â\n","\n","âItâs a bit odd,â said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. âSheâs supposed to be guarding the school, why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when heâs not even here?â\n","\n","âI had a thought,â said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermioneâs territory than his. âYou donât think she can have beenâ¦ you knowâ¦ in love with Sirius?â\n","\n","Hermione stared at him. âWhat on earth makes you say that?â\n","\n","âI dunno,â said Harry, shrugging, âbut she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name, and her Patronus is a big fourlegged thing now. I wondered whether it hadnât becomeâ¦ you knowâ¦ him.â\n","\n","âItâs a thought,â said Hermione slowly. âBut I still donât know why sheâd be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if thatâs really why she was here.â\n","\n","âGoes back to what I said, doesnât it?â said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. âSheâs gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,â he said wisely to Harry, âtheyâre easily upset.â\n","\n","âAnd yet,â said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, âI doubt youâd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didnât laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.â\n","\n","Ron scowled.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 22: After the Burial\n","\n","\n","Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harryâs mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.\n","\n","âFor the last time, just forget about Malfoy,â Hermione told Harry firmly.\n","\n","They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet â Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them â for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.\n","\n","Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner.\n","\n","âIt isnât Lavender,â said Hermione wearily.\n","\n","âOh, good,â said Ron, relaxing.\n","\n","âHarry Potter?â said the girl. âI was asked to give you this.â\n","\n","âThanksâ¦â\n","\n","Harryâs heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, âDumbledore said we wouldnât be having any more lessons until I got the memory!â\n","\n","âMaybe he wants to check on how youâre doing?â suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledoreâs long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.\n","\n","Dear Harry, Ron and Hermione! Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him and you know how special he was. Hermione, I know youâd have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if youâd nip down for the burial later this evening. Iâm planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. I know youâre not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldnât ask, but I canât face it alone. Hagrid\n","\n","âLook at this,â said Harry, handing the note to Hermione. âOh, for heavenâs sake,â she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous. âHeâs mentalâ he said furiously. âThat thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!â\n","\n","âIts not just that,â said Hermione. âHeâs asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows securityâs a million times tighter and how much trouble weâd be in if we were caught.â\n","\n","âWeâve been down to see him by night before,â said Harry.\n","\n","âYes, but for something like this?â said Hermione. âWeâve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all â Aragogâs dead. If it were a question of saving him ââ\n","\n","ââ Iâd want to go even less,â said Ron firmly. âYou didnât meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot.â\n","\n","Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. . . .\n","\n","âHarry, you canât be thinking of going,â said Hermione. âItâs such a pointless thing to get detention for.â\n","\n","Harry sighed. âYeah, I know,â he said. âI sâpose Hagridâll have to bury Aragog without us.â\n","\n","âYes, he will,â said Hermione, looking relieved. âLook, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!â\n","\n","âFiftyseventh time lucky, you think?â said Harry bitterly.\n","\n","âLucky,â said Ron suddenly. âHarry, thatâs it â get lucky!â\n","\n","âWhat dâyou mean?â\n","\n","âUse your lucky potion!â\n","\n","âRon, thatâs â thatâs it!â said Hermione, sounding stunned. âOf course! Why didnât I think of it?â\n","\n","Harry stared at them both. âFelix Felicis?â he said. âI dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. â¦â\n","\n","âWhat for?â demanded Ron incredulously.\n","\n","âWhat on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?â asked Hermione.\n","\n","Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . .\n","\n","âHarry? Are you still with us?â asked Hermione.\n","\n","âWha â ? Yeah, of course,â he said, pulling himself together. âWell. . . okay. If I canât get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, Iâll take some Felix and have another go this evening.â\n","\n","âThatâs decided, then,â said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. âDestination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .â she murmured.\n","\n","âOh, stop that,â Ron begged her, âI feel sick enough as it is â quick, hide me!â\n","\n","âIt isnât Lavender!â said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.\n","\n","âCool,â said Ron, peering over Hermiones shoulder to check. âBlimey, they donât look happy, do they?â\n","\n","âTheyâre the Montgomery sisters and of course they donât look happy, didnât you hear what happened to their little brother?â said Hermione.\n","\n","âIâm losing track of whatâs happening to everyoneâs relatives, to be honest,â said Ron.\n","\n","âWell, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungos, they couldnât save him.â\n","\n","âHe died?â repeated Harry, shocked. âBut surely werewolves donât kill, they just turn you into one of them?â\n","\n","âThey sometimes kill,â said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. âIâve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.â\n","\n","âWhat was the werewolfâs name?â said Harry quickly.\n","\n","âWell, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,â said Hermione.\n","\n","âI knew it â the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!â said Harry angrily.\n","\n","Hermione looked at him bleakly.\n","\n","âHarry, youâve got to get that memory,â she said. âItâs all about stopping Voldemort, isnât it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him. . . .â\n","\n","The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified.\n","\n","âYouâll do fine,â Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test. âGood luck.â\n","\n","âAnd you too!â said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.\n","\n","There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy.\n","\n","âAll too young to Apparate just yet?â said Slughorh genially, âNot turned seventeen yet?â\n","\n","They shook their heads.\n","\n","âAh well,â said Slughorn cheerily, âas weâre so few, weâll do something for fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!â\n","\n","âThat sounds good, sir,â said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile. âWhat do you mean, âsomething amusingâ?â he said irritably. âOh, surprise me,â said Slughorn airily.\n","\n","Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced PotionMaking with a sulky expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.\n","\n","Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner! Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort. . . . There could be only one conclusion, in Harryâs opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.\n","\n","Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking and found a heavily corrected HalfBlood Princeâs version of âAn Elixir to Induce Euphoria,â which seemed not only to meet Slughornâs instructions, but which might (Harryâs heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . .\n","\n","âWell, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,â said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harryâs cauldron. âEuphoria, I take it? And whatâs that I smell? Mmmm . . . youâve added just a sprig of peppermint, havenât you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nosetweaking. â¦ I really donât know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless ââ\n","\n","Harry pushed the HalfBlood Princeâs book deeper into his bag with his foot.\n","\n","ââ itâs just your motherâs genes coming out in you!â\n","\n","âOh . . . yeah, maybe,â said Harry, relieved.\n","\n","Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sourfaced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely âpassable.â\n","\n","The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. âSir,â Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could.\n","\n","âProfessor â Professor, donât you want to taste my po â ?â called Harry desperately.\n","\n","But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the cauldron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.\n","\n","Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.\n","\n","âHarry!â cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. âHarry, I passed!â\n","\n","âWell done!â he said. âAnd Ron?â\n","\n","âHe â he just failed,â whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. âIt was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that heâd left half an eyebrow behind. . . How did it go with Slughorn?â\n","\n","âNo joy,â said Harry, as Ron joined them. âBad luck, mate, but youâll pass next time â we can take it together.â\n","\n","âYeah, I sâpose,â said Ron grumpily. âBut half an eyebrow â like that matters!â\n","\n","âI know,â said Hermione soothingly, âit does seem really harsh. â¦â\n","\n","They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory.\n","\n","âSo, Harry â you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?â Ron demanded.\n","\n","âYeah, I sâpose Iâd better,â said Harry. âI donât reckon Iâll need all of it, not twentyfour hoursâ worth, it canât take all nightâ¦. Iâll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.â\n","\n","âItâs a great feeling when you take it,â said Ron reminiscently. âLike you canât do anything wrong.â\n","\n","âWhat are you talking about?â said Hermione, laughing. âYouâve never taken any!â\n","\n","âYeah, but I thought I had, didnât I?â said Ron, as though explaining the obvious. âSame difference really â¦â\n","\n","As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boysâ dormitory.\n","\n","Harry took out the rolledup socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.\n","\n","âWell, here goes,â said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp.\n","\n","âWhat does it feel like?â whispered Hermione.\n","\n","Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at allâ¦ and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. . . .\n","\n","He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.\n","\n","âExcellent,â he said. âReally excellent. Right. . . Iâm going down to Hagridâs.â\n","\n","âWhat?â said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.\n","\n","âNo, Harry â youâve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?â said Hermione.\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry confidently. âIâm going to Hagridâs, Iâve got a good feeling about going to Hagridâs.â\n","\n","âYouâve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?â asked Ron, looking stunned.\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. âI feel like itâs the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.\n","\n","âThis is Felix Felicis, I suppose?â said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. âYou havenât got another little bottle full ofâ I donât know ââ\n","\n","âEssence of Insanity?â suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders.\n","\n","Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.\n","\n","âTrust me,â he said. âI know what Iâm doing â¦ or at leastâ he strolled confidently to the doorâ âFelix does.â\n","\n","He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door.\n","\n","âWhat were you doing up there with her!â shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boysâ dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.\n","\n","Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny.\n","\n","âDonât push me, please, Dean,â she said, sounding annoyed. ; âYouâre always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. â¦â\n","\n","The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort.. . . His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.\n","\n","Why he knew that going to Hagridâs was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.\n","\n","It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagridâs. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation.\n","\n","âI do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,â Slughorn was saying courteously, âmost authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.â\n","\n","âOh, I quite agree,â said Professor Sprout warmly. âThat enough for you?â\n","\n","âPlenty, plenty,â said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. âThis should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody overstews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!â\n","\n","Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible.\n","\n","Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pullet I off the cloak with a flourish.\n","\n","âGood evening, Professor.â\n","\n","âMerlinâs beard, Harry, you made me jump,â said Slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. âHow did you get out of the castle?â\n","\n","âI think Filch mustâve forgotten to lock the doors,â said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl.\n","\n","âIâll be reporting that man, heâs more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out then, Harry?â\n","\n","âWell, sir, itâs Hagrid,â said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. âHeâs pretty upset. . . But you wonât tell anyone, Professor? I donât want trouble for him. â¦â\n","\n","Slughornâs curiosity was evidently aroused. âWell, I canât promise that,â he said gruffly. âBut I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so Iâm sure he canât be up to anything very dreadful. ..â\n","\n","âWell, itâs this giant spider, heâs had it for years. â¦ It lived in the forest. â¦ It could talk and everything ââ\n","\n","âI heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,â said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. âItâs true, then?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry. âBut this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. Heâs devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said Iâd go.â\n","\n","âTouching, touching,â said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagridâs cabin. âBut acromantula venom is very valuable â¦ If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldnât want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some â¦ I mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. â¦â\n","\n","Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now. â. . . seems an awful waste not to collect itâ¦ might get a hundred Galleons a pint. â¦ To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .â\n","\n","And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done. âWell,â he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, âwell, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better sendoff, you know â¦â\n","\n","âYes, of course,â said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm. âI tell you what, Harry, Iâll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . Weâll drink the poor beastâs â well â not health â but weâll send it off in style, anyway, once itâs buried. And Iâll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occasion. . . .â\n","\n","He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagridâs, delighted with himself.\n","\n","âYen came,â croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.\n","\n","âYeah â Ron and Hermione couldnât, though,â said Harry. âTheyâre really sorry.â\n","\n","âDon â don matter . . . Hedâve bin touched yehâre here, though, Harry. . .â\n","\n","Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach.\n","\n","âWhere are we burying him?â he asked. âThe forest?â\n","\n","âBlimey, no,â said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. âThe other spiders wonâ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragogâs gone. Turns out it was only on his orders they didnâ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?â\n","\n","The honest answer was âyesâ; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come facetoface with the aeromantulas. They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.\n","\n","âNever bin an area oâ the forest I couldnâ go before!â said Hagrid, shaking his head. âIt wasnâ easy, gettinâ Aragogâs body out oâ there, I can tell yeh â they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give âim a nice burialâ¦ a proper sendoff. . .â\n","\n","He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), âProfessor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.â\n","\n","âNot in trouble, are yeh?â said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. âYeh shouldnâ be outta the castle in the eveninâ, I know it, itâs my fault ââ\n","\n","âNo, no, when he heard what I was doing he said heâd like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,â said Harry.\n","\n","âHeâs gone to change into something more suitable, I thinkâ¦and he said heâd bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragogâs memoryâ¦â\n","\n","âDid he?â said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. âThaâs â thaâs righâ nice of him, that is, anâ not turninâ yeh in either. Iâve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. .. . Cominâ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well. . . heâdâve liked that, Aragog would. . . .â\n","\n","Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagridâs hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled.\n","\n","âAre we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?â\n","\n","âJusâ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,â said Hagrid in a choked voice. âIâve already dug the â yeh know â grave. Jusâ thought weâd say a few nice things over him â happy memories, yeh know ââ\n","\n","His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat.\n","\n","âHagrid,â he said, in a deep, grave voice. âSo very sorry to hear of your loss.â\n","\n","âThaâs very nice of yeh,â said Hagrid. âThanks a lot. Anâ thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither. . . .â\n","\n","âWouldnât have dreamed of it,â said Slughorn. âSad night, sad night. . . Where is the poor creature?â\n","\n","âOut here,â said Hagrid in a shaking voice. âShall we â shall we do it, then?â\n","\n","The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagridâs window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a tenfoot- high mound of freshly dug earth.\n","\n","âMagnificent,â said Slughorn, approaching the spiders head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thougln he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.\n","\n","âIts not evâryone appreciates how beauâiful they areâ said H grid to Slughornâs back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. âI didnâ know yeh were interested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.â\n","\n","âInterested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,â said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. âNow . . . shall we proceed to the burial?â\n","\n","Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.\n","\n","âOf course, itâs difficult for you, who knew him best,â said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagridâs elbow, but patted it all the same. âWhy donât I say a few words?â\n","\n","He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, âFarewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you wonât forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, webspun places of your forest home. May your manyeyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.â\n","\n","âTha was . . . tha was . . . beauâiful!â howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.\n","\n","âThere, there,â said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. âLets get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . Thatâs it. â¦ Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done â¦â\n","\n","They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harryâs lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.\n","\n","âI have had it all tested for poison,â he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagridâs bucketsized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. âHad a houseelf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.â\n","\n","Harry saw, in his mindâs eye, the expression on Hermioneâs face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves, and decided never to mention it to her.\n","\n","âOne for Harry . . .â said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, â. . . and one for me. Wellâ â he raised his mug high â âto Aragog.â\n","\n","âAragog,â said Harry and Hagrid together. Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him.\n","\n","âI had him from an egg, yeh know,â said Hagrid morosely. ââTiny little thing he was when he hatched. âBout the size of a Pekingeseâ\n","\n","âSweet,â said Slughorn.\n","\n","âUsed ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . wellâ¦â\n","\n","Hagridâs face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair.\n","\n","âThatâs not unicorn hair, Hagrid?â\n","\n","âOh, yeah,â said Hagrid indifferently. âGets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches anâ stuff in the forest, yeh know â¦â\n","\n","âBut my dear chap, do you know how much thatâs worth?â\n","\n","âI use it fer bindinâ on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured,â said Hagrid, shrugging. âItâs dead useful. . . very strong.â\n","\n","Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful su ply of oakmatured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled Hagridâs mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughornâs flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.\n","\n","The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slugliorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.\n","\n","After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elfmade wine, and to-\n","\n","âHarry Potter!â bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.\n","\n","âYes, indeed,â cried Slughorn a little thickly, âParry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who â well â something of that sort,â he mumbled, and drained his mug too.\n","\n","Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, âTo friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!â\n","\n","And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.\n","\n","âAaargh, the good die young,â muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little crosseyed, while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain. âMe dad was no age ter go â¦ nor were yer mumâ anâ dad, Harry . . .â\n","\n","Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagridâs crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harryâs arm and shook it\n","\n","âBesâ wiz and witchard oâ their age â¦ I never knew.. . terrible thing . . . terrible thing â¦â\n","\n","âAnd Odo the hero, they bore him back home\n","\n","To the place that heâd known as a lad,â\n","\n","sang Slughorn plaintively.\n","\n","âThey laid him to rest with his hat inside out.\n","\n","And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.â\n","\n","â. . . terrible,â Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply.\n","\n","âSorry,â said Slughorn with a hiccup. âCanât carry a tune to save my life.â\n","\n","âHagrid wasnât talking about your singing,â said Harry quietly. âHe was talking about my mum and dad dying.â\n","\n","âOh,â said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. âOh dear. Yes, that was â was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible â¦â\n","\n","He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs.\n","\n","âI donât â donât suppose you remember it, Harry?â he asked awkwardly.\n","\n","âNo â well, I was only one when they died,â said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagridâs heavy snores. âBut Iâve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?â\n","\n","âI â I didnât,â said Slughorn in a hushed voice.\n","\n","âYeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,â said Harry.\n","\n","Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harryâs face.\n","\n","âHe told her to get out of the way,â said Harry remorselessly. âHe told me she neednât have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.â\n","\n","âOh dear,â breathed Slughorn. âShe could have . . . she neednât . . . Thatâs awful. . . .â\n","\n","âIt is, isnât it?â said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. âBut she didnât move. Dad was already dead, but she didnât want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort. . . but he just laughedâ¦.â\n","\n","âThatâs enough!â said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. âReally, my dear boy, enough . . . Iâm an old man â¦ I donât need to hear â¦ I donât want to hear â¦â\n","\n","âI forgot,â lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. âYou liked her, didnât you?â\n","\n","âLiked her?â said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. âI donât imagine anyone who met her wouldnât have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funnyâ¦ It was the most horrible thing. â¦â\n","\n","âBut you wonât help her son,â said Harry. âShe gave me her life, but you wonât give me a memory.â\n","\n","Hagridâs rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughornâs tearfilled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.\n","\n","âDonât say that,â he whispered. âIt isnât a question â¦ If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . .â\n","\n","âIt can,â said Harry clearly. âDumbledore needs information. I need information.â\n","\n","He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little.\n","\n","âI am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.â\n","\n","Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.\n","\n","âYou are the Chosen One?â . . I.\n","\n","âOf course I am,â said Harry calmly.\n","\n","âBut then . . . my dear boy . . . youâre asking a great deal. . . youâre asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy-â\n","\n","âYou donât want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?ââ\n","\n","âHarry, Harry, of course I do, but ââ\n","\n","âYouâre scared heâll find out you helped me?â\n","\n","Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.\n","\n","âBe brave like my mother, Professor. . . .â\n","\n","Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby.\n","\n","âI am not proud . . .â he whispered through his fingers. âI am ashamed of what â of what that memory shows. â¦ I think I may have done great damage that day. â¦â\n","\n","âYouâd cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,â said Harry. âIt would be a very brave and noble thing to do.â\n","\n","Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait. Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harryâs eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.\n","\n","âThank you very much, Professor.â\n","\n","âYouâre a good boy,â said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. âAnd youâve got her eyes. . . . Just donât think too badly of me once youâve seen it. . . ,â\n","\n","And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 23: Horcruxes\n","\n","\n","Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood.\n","\n","âWhat sort of time do you call this?â\n","\n","âIâm really sorry â I had to go out for something important ââ\n","\n","âWell, the password changed at midnight, so youâll just have to sleep in the corridor, wonât you?â\n","\n","âYouâre joking!â said Harry. âWhy did it have to change at midnight?â\n","\n","âThatâs the way it is,â said the Fat Lady. âIf youâre angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, heâs the one whoâs tightened security.â\n","\n","âFantastic,â said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. âReally brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because heâs the one who wanted me to ââ\n","\n","âHe is here,â said a voice behind Harry. âProfessor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.â\n","\n","Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.\n","\n","âI had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,â said Nick. âHe appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.â\n","\n","âWhere is he?â said Harry, his heart leaping,â\n","\n","âOh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, itâs a, favorite pastime of his ââ\n","\n","âNot the Bloody Baron â Dumbledore!â\n","\n","âOh â in his office,â said Nick. âI believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in ââ\n","\n","âYeah, he has,â said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him.\n","\n","âCome back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The passwordâs still âtapewormâ!â\n","\n","But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying âtoffee eclairsâ to Dumbledoreâs gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase.\n","\n","âEnter,â said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledoreâs office, looking the same as ever, but with black, starstrewn skies beyond the windows.\n","\n","âGood gracious, Harry,â said Dumbledore in surprise. âTo what do I owe this very late pleasure?â\n","\n","âSir â Iâve got it. Iâve got the memory from Slughorn.â\n","\n","Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.\n","\n","âHarry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!â\n","\n","All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughornâs memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve.\n","\n","âAnd now,â said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. âNow, at last. we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .â\n","\n","Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughornâs office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, strawcolored hair and his gingeryblond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple. And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvoloâs goldandblack ring gleaming on his finger.\n","\n","Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, âSir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?â\n","\n","âTom, Tom, if I knew I couldnât tell you,â said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. âI must say, Iâd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.â\n","\n","Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\n","\n","âWhat with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnât, and your careful flattery of the people who matter â thank you for the pineapple, by the way, youâre quite right, it is my favorite ââ Several of the boys tittered again. ââ I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.â\n","\n","Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.\n","\n","âI donât know that politics would suit me, sir,â he said when the laughter had died away. âI donât have the right kind of background, for one thing.â\n","\n","A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leaderâs famous ancestor.\n","\n","âNonsense,â said Slughorn briskly, âcouldnât be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, youâll go far, Tom, Iâve never been wrong about a student yet.â\n","\n","The small golden clock standing upon Slughornâs desk chimed eleven oâclock behind him and he looked around.\n","\n","âGood gracious, is it that time already? Youâd better get going boys, or weâll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by in morrow or itâs detention. Same goes for you, Avery.â\n","\n","One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there.\n","\n","âLook shar\n","\n","p, Tom, you donât want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect.. .â\n","\n","âSir, I wanted to ask you something.â -â âAsk away, then, mâboy, ask away. . . .â\n","\n","âSir, I wondered what you know about. . . about Horcruxes?â\n","\n","Slughorn stared at him, his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass.\n","\n","âProject for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?â\n","\n","But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.\n","\n","âNot exactly, sir,â said Riddle. âI came across the term while reading and I didnât fully understand it.â\n","\n","âNo . . . well. . . youâd be hardpushed to find a book at Hogwarts thatâll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, thatâs very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,â said Slughorn.\n","\n","âBut you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you â sorry, I mean, if you canât tell me, obviously â I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could â so I just thought Iâd ââ\n","\n","It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.\n","\n","âWell,â said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple, âwell, it canât hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand t he term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.â\n","\n","âI donât quite understand how that works, though, sir,â said Riddle.\n","\n","His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.\n","\n","âWell, you split your soul, you see,â said Slughorn, âand hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if oneâs body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form â¦â\n","\n","Slughornâs face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: âI was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive.â\n","\n","ââ¦ few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.â\n","\n","But Riddleâs hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing.\n","\n","âHow do you split your soul?â\n","\n","âWell,â said Slughorn uncomfortably, âyou must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting n it I an act of violation, it is against nature.â\n","\n","âBut how do you do it?â\n","\n","âBy an act of evil â the supreme act of evil. By commiting murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion ââ\n","\n","âEncase? But how â ?â\n","\n","âThere is a spell, do not ask me, I donât know!â said Slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. â Do I look as though I have tried it â do I look like a killer?â\n","\n","âNo, sir, of course not,â said Riddle quickly. âIâm sorry â¦ I didnât mean to offend . . .â\n","\n","âNot at all, not at all, not offended,â said Slughorn gruffly, âIt is natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .â\n","\n","âYes, sir,â said Riddle. âWhat I donât understand, though â just out of curiosity â I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldnât it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isnât seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldnât seven â ?â\n","\n","âMerlinâs beard, Tom!â yelped Slughorn. âSeven! Isnât it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .â\n","\n","Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.\n","\n","âOf course,â he muttered, âthis is all hypothetical, what weâre discussing, isnât it? All academic . . .â\n","\n","âYes, sir, of course,â said Riddle quickly.\n","\n","âBut all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what Iâve told â thatâs to say, what weâve discussed. People wouldnât like to think weâve been chatting about Horcruxes. Itâs a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledoreâs particularly fierce about it. â¦â\n","\n","âI wonât say a word, sir,â said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . .\n","\n","âThank you, Harry,â said Dumbledore quietly. âLet us go. . . .â\n","\n","When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was ; already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak.\n","\n","âI have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,â said Dumbledore at last. âIt confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. â¦â\n","\n","Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.\n","\n","âWell, Harry,â said Dumbledore, âI am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.â\n","\n","âYou think he succeeded then, sir?â asked Harry. âHe made a Horcrux? And thatâs why he didnât die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?â\n","\n","âA bitâ¦ or more,â said Dumbledore. âYou heard Voldemort, what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxc. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know â as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew â no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.â\n","\n","Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thought, and then said, âFour years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.â\n","\n","âWhere?â asked Harry. âHow?â\n","\n","âYou handed it to me, Harry,â said Dumbledore. âThe diary, Riddles diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.â\n","\n","âI donât understand, sir,â said Harry.\n","\n","âWell, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. â¦ a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.â\n","\n","â1 still donât understand,â said Harry.\n","\n","âWell, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work â in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherinâs monster would be unleashed again.â\n","\n","âWell, he didnât want his hard work to be wasted,â said Harry. âHe wanted people to know he was Slytherinâs heir, because he couldnât take credit at the time.â\n","\n","âQuite correct,â said Dumbledore, nodding. âBut donât you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody elseâs path and run the risk that they might destroy it â as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.\n","\n","The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made â or had been planning to make â more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. âI who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.â That was what you told me he said. âFurther than anybody!â And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I donât believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call âusual evilâ . . .â\n","\n","âSo heâs made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?â said Harry. âWhy couldnât he make a Sorcererâs Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?â\n","\n","âWell, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,â s;nÂ«l Dumbledore. âBut there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcererâs Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort,\n","\n","âWhile the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see â¦ or as close to immortal as any man can be. But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: âWouldnât it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isnât seven the most powerfully magical number . . .â Isnât seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.â\n","\n","âHe made seven Horcruxes?â said Harry, horrorstruck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. âBut they could be anywhere in the world â hidden â buried or invisible ââ\n","\n","âI am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,â said Dumbledore calmly. âBut firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack â the piece that lives in his body.â\n","\n","âBut the six Horcruxes, then,â said Harry, a little desperately, âhow are we supposed to find them?â\n","\n","âYou are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.â\n","\n","âYou have?â said Harry eagerly.\n","\n","âYes indeed,â said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burnedlooking hand. âThe ring, Harry. Marvoloâs ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been â forgive me the lack of seemly modesty â for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snapeâs timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemortâs soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.â\n","\n","âBut how did you find it?â\n","\n","âWell, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemortâs past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gauntâs house. It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.\n","\n","âHowever, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a sevenpart soul, four Horcruxes remain.â\n","\n","âAnd they could be anything?â said Harry. âThey could be oh, in tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .â\n","\n","âYou are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things, suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.â\n","\n","âThe diary wasnât that special.â\n","\n","âThe diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin. I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.â\n","\n","âSo, the other Horcruxes?â said Harry. âDo you think you know what they are, sir?â\n","\n","âI can only guess,â said Dumbledore. âFor the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemortâs past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.â\n","\n","âThe locket!â said Harry loudly, âHufflepuffâs cup!â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore, smiling, âI would be prepared to bet â perhaps not my other hand â but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemortâs imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclawâs. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.â\n","\n","Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a rubyencrusted sword reposed within a glass case.\n","\n","âDo you think thatâs why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?â said Harry. âTo try and find something from one of the other founders?â\n","\n","âMy thoughts precisely,â said Dumbledore. âBut unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four foundersâ objects. He definitely had two â he may have found three â that is the best we can do for now.â\n","\n","âEven if he got something of Ravenclawâs or of Gryffindorâs, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,â said Harry, counting on his fingers. âUnless heâs got both?â\n","\n","âI donât think so,â said Dumbledore. âI think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?â\n","\n","âThe snake?â said Harry, startled. âYou can use animals as Horcruxes?â\n","\n","âWell, it is inadvisable to do so,â said Dumbledore, âbecause to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parentsâ house with the intention of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.â\n","\n","âSo,â said Harry, âthe diaryâs gone, the ringâs gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclawâs or Gryffindorâs?â\n","\n","âAn admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,â said Dumbledore, bowing his head.\n","\n","âSo . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where youâve been going when youâve been leaving the school?â\n","\n","âCorrect,â said Dumbledore. âI have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps â¦ I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.â\n","\n","âAnd if you do,â said Harry quickly, âcan I come with you and help get rid of it?â\n","\n","Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, âYes, I think so.â\n","\n","âI can?â said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.\n","\n","âOh yes,â said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. âI think you have earned that right.â\n","\n","Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledoreâs decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.\n","\n","âDoes Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?â Harry asked, ignoring the portraits.\n","\n","âA very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.â\n","\n","âBut I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?â\n","\n","âYes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts sayso, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Luciusâs fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence â but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.â\n","\n","Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, âSo if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed?â\n","\n","âYes, I think so,â said Dumbledore. âWithout his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.â\n","\n","âBut I havenât got uncommon skill and power,â said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n","\n","âYes, you have,â said Dumbledore firmly. âYou have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can ââ\n","\n","âI know!â said Harry impatiently. âI can love!â It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, âBig deal!â\n","\n","âYes, Harry, you can love,â said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. âWhich, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.â\n","\n","âSo, when the prophecy says that Iâll have âpower the Dark Lord knows not,â it just means â love?â asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\n","\n","âYes â just love,â said Dumbledore. âBut Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him â and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!â\n","\n","âBut it comes to the same ââ\n","\n","âNo, it doesnât!â said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, âYou are setting too much store by the prophecy!â\n","\n","âBut,â spluttered Harry, âbut you said the prophecy means ââ\n","\n","âIf Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?â\n","\n","âBut,â said Harry, bewildered, âbut last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other ââ\n","\n","âHarry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawneyâs words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Donât you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!â\n","\n","âBut ââ\n","\n","âIt is essential that you understand this!â said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. âBy attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemortâs fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemortâs world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemortâs followers!â\n","\n","âOf course I havenât!â said Harry indignantly. âHe killed my mum and dad!â\n","\n","âYou are protected, in short, by your ability to love!â said Dumbledore loudly. âThe only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemortâs! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heartâs desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemortâs mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.â\n","\n","âBut, sir,â said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, âit all comes to the same thing, doesnât it? Iâve got to try and kill him, or ââ\n","\n","âGot to?â said Dumbledore. âOf course youâve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until youâve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,\n","\n","that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!â\n","\n","Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\n","\n","âIâd want him finished,â said Harry quietly. âAnd Iâd want to do it.â\n","\n","âOf course you would!â cried Dumbledore. âYou see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. â¦ In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that ââ\n","\n","âThat one of us is going to end up killing the other,â said Harry. âYes.â\n","\n","But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew â and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents â that there was all the difference in the world.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 24: Sectumsempra\n","\n","\n","Exhausted but delighted with his nightâs work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morningâs Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemortâs Horcruxes and Dumbledoreâs promise to take Harry along, should he find another one.\n","\n","âWow,â said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. âWow. Youâre actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow.â\n","\n","âRon, youâre making it snow,â said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Rons arm.\n","\n","âOh yeah,â said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. âSorryâ¦ looks like weâve all got horrible dandruff now. â¦â\n","\n","He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.\n","\n","âWe split up,â he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth, âLast night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldnât see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.â\n","\n","âAh,â said Harry. âWell â you donât mind itâs over, do you?â, âNo,â Ron admitted. âIt was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didnât have to finish it.â\n","\n","âCoward,â said Hermione, though she looked amused. âWell, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.â\n","\n","Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, âHow come?â\n","\n","âOh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldnât climb in herself . . . but theyâve been a bit rocky for ages.â\n","\n","Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.\n","\n","âOf course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesnât it?â said Hermione.\n","\n","âWhat dâyou mean?â said Harry quickly.\n","\n","âThe Quidditch team,â said Hermione. âIf Ginnyand Dean arenât speaking . . .â\n","\n","âOh â oh yeah,â said Harry.\n","\n","âFlitwick,â said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harryâs and Ronâs were still murky brown.\n","\n","âNow, now, boys,â squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. âA little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . .â\n","\n","Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harryâs vinegar turned to ice; Rons flask exploded.\n","\n","âYes â¦ for homework,â said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, âpractice.â\n","\n","They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, âItâs a nice day.â Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harryâs brain:\n","\n","Sheâs Rons sister.\n","\n","But sheâs ditched Dean!\n","\n","Sheâs still Rons sister.\n","\n","Iâm his best mate!\n","\n","Thatâll make it worse.\n","\n","If I talked to him first â\n","\n","Heâd hit you.\n","\n","What if I donât care?\n","\n","Heâs your best mate!\n","\n","Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, âKatie! Youâre back! Are you okay?â\n","\n","Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends.\n","\n","âIâm really well!â she said happily. âThey let me out of St. Mungos on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry. . . .â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry, âwell, now youâre back and Ronâs fit, weâll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .â\n","\n","He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katieâs friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.\n","\n","â. . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. âEveryoneâs been asking me, but I havenât got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladiesâ in the Three Broomsticks.â\n","\n","âYou definitely went into the bathroom, then?â said Hermione.\n","\n","âWell, I know I pushed open the door,â said Katie, âso I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memoryâs a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungoâs. Listen, Iâd better go, I wouldnât put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. â¦â\n","\n","She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them.\n","\n","âSo it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,â said Hermione, âto be in the ladiesâ bathroom.â\n","\n","âOr someone who looked like a girl or a woman,â said Harry. âDonât forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen. . . .â\n","\n","In his mindâs eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls.\n","\n","âI think Iâm going to take another swig of Felix,â said Harry, âand have a go at the Room of Requirement again.â\n","\n","âThat would be a complete waste of potion,â said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. âLuck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isnât enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Donât go wasting the rest of that potion! Youâll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him â¦â She dropped her voice to a whisper.\n","\n","âCouldnât we make some more?â Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. âItâd be great to have a stock of it. â¦ Have a look in the bookâ¦ â\n","\n","Harry pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bap, and looked up Felix Felicis.\n","\n","âBlimey, its seriously complicated,â he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. âAnd it takes six months.,. Youâve got to let it stew. â¦â\n","\n","âTypical,â said Ron.\n","\n","Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned âFor Enemies,â that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.\n","\n","The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.\n","\n","The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.\n","\n","Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.\n","\n","The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the postLavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ronâs expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . .\n","\n","Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around â but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermioneâs help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didnât do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good.\n","\n","All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, âtweaking the circumstancesâ? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harryâs shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else.\n","\n","Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the GryffindorRavenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottomofthetable defeat in two centuries.\n","\n","The runup to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harryâs mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud aftermatch party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.\n","\n","In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauderâs Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.\n","\n","A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventhfloor corridor, checking the Marauderâs Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoyâs tiny, labeled dot standing in a boysâ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.\n","\n","Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.\n","\n","Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his whiteblond head bowed.\n","\n","âDonât,â crooned Moaning Myrtleâs voice from one of the cubicles. âDonât. . . tell me whatâs wrong â¦ I can help you. . . .â\n","\n","âNo one can help me,â said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. âI canât do it. â¦ I canât. â¦ It wonât work . . . and unless 1 do it soon â¦ he says heâll kill me. â¦â\n","\n","And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying â actually crying â tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into flucracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder.\n","\n","Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoyâs hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another â\n","\n","âNo! No! Stop it!â squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. âStop! STOP!â\n","\n","There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a LegLocker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoyâs ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, âCruci ââ\n","\n","âSECTUMSEMPRA!â bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.\n","\n","Blood spurted from Malfoyâs face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.\n","\n","âNo ââ gasped Harry.\n","\n","Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his bloodsoaked chest.\n","\n","âNo â I didnât ââ\n","\n","Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: âMURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!â\n","\n","The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harryâs curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoyâs face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.\n","\n","Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he halflifted Malfoy into a standing position.\n","\n","âYou need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.. . . Comeâ¦.â\n","\n","He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, âAnd you, Potter . . . You wait here for me.â\n","\n","It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment.\n","\n","Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.\n","\n","âGo,â he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her.\n","\n","âI didnât mean it to happen,â said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. âI didnât know what that spell did.â\n","\n","But Snape ignored this. âApparently I underestimated you, Potter,â he said quietly. âWho would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?â\n","\n","âI â read about it somewhere.â\n","\n","âWhere?â\n","\n","âIt was â a library book,â Harry invented wildly. âI canât remember what it was call ââ\n","\n","âLiar,â said Snape. Harryâs throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. â¦\n","\n","The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the HalfBlood Princeâs copy of Advanced PotionMaking swam hazily to the forefront of his mind.\n","\n","And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snapeâs black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but â\n","\n","âBring me your schoolbag,â said Snape softly, âand all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!â\n","\n","There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed\n","\n","out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past.\n","\n","He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell Slughorn â Harryâs stomach churned â how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not. . .\n","\n","âWhereâve you â ? Why are you soaking â ? Is that blood.â Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at , the sight of Harry.\n","\n","âI need your book,â Harry panted. âYour Potions book. Quick . . . give it to me . . .â\n","\n","âBut what about the HalfBlood ââ\n","\n","âIâll explain later!â\n","\n","Ron pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventhfloor corridor.\n","\n","He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk.\n","\n","I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. â¦\n","\n","Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung him self inside, and slammed it shut.\n","\n","He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castleproud houseelves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.\n","\n","Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboardâs creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the HalfBlood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone.\n","\n","Harry ran flatout toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ronâs copy of Advanced PotionMaking into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harryâs schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited.\n","\n","One by one, Snape extracted Harrys books and examined them., Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking.\n","\n","âThis is your copy of Advanced PotionMaking, is it, Potter?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry, still breathing hard.\n","\n","âYouâre quite sure of that, are you, Potter?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry, with a touch more defiance.\n","\n","âThis is the copy of Advanced PotionMaking that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry firmly.\n","\n","âThen why,â asked Snape, âdoes it have the name âRoonil Wazlibâ written inside the front cover?â\n","\n","Harrys heart missed a beat. âThatâs my nickname,â he said. â\n","\n","âYour nickname,â repeated Snape. ; âYeah . . . thatâs what my friends call me,â said Harry.\n","\n","âI understand what a nickname is,â said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harryâs; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind. . . . Close your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to do it properly. . . .\n","\n","âDo you know what I think, Potter?â said Snape, very quietly. âI think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. âWhat do you think, Potter?â\n","\n","âI â I donât agree, sir,â said Harry, still refusing to look into Snapeâs eyes.\n","\n","âWell, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,â said Snape. âTen oâclock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.â\n","\n","âBut sir . . .â said Harry, looking up desperately. âQuidditch . . . the last match of the â¦â\n","\n","âTen oâclock,â whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. âPoor Gryffindor. . . fourth place this year, I fear â¦â\n","\n","And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.\n","\n","âI wonât say âI told you so,ââ said Hermione, an hour later in the common room.\n","\n","âLeave it, Hermione,â said Ron angrily.\n","\n","Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snapeâs punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.\n","\n","âI told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,â Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. âAnd I was right, wasnât I.â\n","\n","âNo, I donât think you were,â said Harry stubbornly.\n","\n","He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor teamâs faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginnyâs eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the postmatch euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . .\n","\n","âHarry,â said Hermione, âhow can you still stick up for that book when that spell ââ\n","\n","âWill you stop harping on about the book!â snapped Harry. âThe Prince only copied it out! Itâs not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!â\n","\n","âI donât believe this,â said Hermione. âYouâre actually defendingâ\n","\n","âIâm not defending what I did!â said Harry quickly. âI wish 1 ; hadnât done it, and not just because Iâve got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldnât've used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you canât blame the Prince, he hadnât written âtry this out, itâs really goodâ â he was just making notes for himself, wasnât he, not for anyone else. . . .â\n","\n","âAre you telling me,â said Hermione, âthat youâre going to go back â ?â\n","\n","âAnd get the book? Yeah, I am,â said Harry forcefully. âListen, without the Prince Iâd never have won the Felix Felicis. Iâd never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, Iâd never have ââ\n","\n","ââ got a reputation for Potions brilliance you donât deserve,â said Hermione nastily.\n","\n","âGive it a rest, Hermione!â said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. âBy the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve!â\n","\n","âWell, of course Iâm glad Harry wasnât cursed!â said Hermione, clearly stung. âBut you canât call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where itâs landed him! And Iâd have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match ââ\n","\n","âOh, donât start acting as though you understand Quidditch,â snapped Ginny, âyouâll only embarrass yourself.â\n","\n","Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however,\n","\n","little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.\n","\n","His lightheartedness was shortlived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.\n","\n","âAh, Potter,â said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them.\n","\n","âMr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,â said Snape softly. âThey are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.â\n","\n","âRight, Professor,â said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables.\n","\n","âI thought you could start,â said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, âwith boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fiftysix. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . .â\n","\n","He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, âJames Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size. Double detention.â Snape sneered. âIt must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains.â\n","\n","Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.\n","\n","It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Siriusâs names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . .\n","\n","Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour â¦ an hour â¦ an hour and a half. . . .\n","\n","Harryâs stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one.\n","\n","âI think that will do,â he said coldly. âMark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten oâclock next Saturday.â Yes, sir.\n","\n","Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. â¦ It was over, then. . . .\n","\n","He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.\n","\n","âQuid agis?â he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.\n","\n","Her expression was unreadable as she replied, âYouâll see.â\n","\n","And she swung forward.\n","\n","A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room.\n","\n","âWe won!â yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. âWe won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!â\n","\n","Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.\n","\n","After several long moments â or it might have been half an hour â or possibly several sunlit days â they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolfwhistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginnyâs head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harryâs eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Wellâif you must.\n","\n","The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which â if they had time â they might discuss the match.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 25: The Seer Overheard\n","\n","\n","The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark magic.\n","\n","âYouâd think people had better things to gossip about,â said Ginny, as she sat on the commonroom floor, leaning against Harryâs legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if itâs true youâve got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest.â\n","\n","Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.\n","\n","âWhat did you tell her?â\n","\n","â ? told her itâs a Hungarian Horntail,â said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. âMuch more macho.â\n","\n","Thanks,â said Harry, grinning. âAnd what did you tell her Ronâs got?â\n","\n","âA Pygmy Puff, but I didnât say where.â\n","\n","Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.\n","\n","âWatch it,â he said, pointing wamingly at Harry and Ginny. âJust because Iâve given my permission doesnât mean I canât withdraw it -â\n","\n","âTour permissionâ,â scoffed Ginny. âSince when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself youâd rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean.â\n","\n","âYeah, 1 would,â said Ron grudgingly. âAnd just as long as you donât start snogging each other in public -â\n","\n","âYou filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place?â demanded Ginny.\n","\n","But Ronâs tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginnyâs time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginnyâs O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.\n","\n","âI want to talk to you, Harry.â\n","\n","âWhat about?â said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.\n","\n","The socalled HalfBlood Prince.â\n","\n","âOh, not again,â he groaned. âWill you please drop it?â\n","\n","He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Princeâs book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout.\n","\n","âIâm not dropping it,â said Hermione firmly, âuntil youâve heard me out. Now, Iâve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells -â\n","\n","âHe didnât make a hobby of it -â\n","\n","âHe, he - who says itâs a he?â\n","\n","âWeâve been through this,â said Harry crossly. âPrince, Hermione, Prince!â\n","\n","âRight!â said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. âLook at that! Look at the picture!â\n","\n","Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look, too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the photograph was the caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team.\n","\n","âSo?â said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.\n","\n","âHer name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.â\n","\n","They looked at each other and Harry realised what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing.\n","\n","âNo way.â\n","\n","âWhat?â\n","\n","âYou think she was the HalfBlood â¦? Oh, come on.â\n","\n","âWell, why not? Harry, there arenât any real princes in the wizarding world! Itâs either a nickname, a madeup title somebodyâs given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldnât it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard\n","\n","whose surname was âPrinceâ, and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a âhalfblood Princeâ!â\n","\n","âYeah, very ingenious, Hermione â¦â\n","\n","âBut it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!â\n","\n","âListen, Hermione, I can tell itâs not a girl. I can just tell.â\n","\n","The truth is that you donât think a girl would have been clever enough,â said Hermione angrily.\n","\n","âHow can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?â said Harry, stung by this. âItâs the way he writes. I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasnât got anything to do with it. Where did you get this, anyway?â\n","\n","âThe library,â said Hermione, predictably. Thereâs a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, Iâm going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.â\n","\n","âEnjoy yourself,â said Harry irritably.\n","\n","âI will,â said Hermione. âAnd the first place Iâll look,â she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, âis records of old Potions awards!â\n","\n","Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky.\n","\n","âSheâs just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,â said Ron, returning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.\n","\n","âYou donât think Iâm mad, wanting that book back, do you?â\n","\n","âCourse not,â said Ron robustly. âHe was a genius, the Prince. Anyway â¦ without his bezoar tip â¦â he drew his finger significantly across his own throat, âI wouldnât be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, Iâm not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great -â\n","\n","âNor am I,â said Harry quickly.\n","\n","âBut he healed all right, didnât he? Back on his feet in no time.â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same. Thanks to Snape â¦â\n","\n","âYou still got detention with Snape this Saturday?â Ron continued.\n","\n","âYeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,â sighed Harry. âAnd heâs hinting now that if I donât get all the boxes done by the end of term, weâll carry on next year.â\n","\n","He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.\n","\n","Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.\n","\n","âThanks, Jimmy â¦ hey, itâs from Dumbledore!â said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. âHe wants me to go to his office as quick as 1 can!â\n","\n","They stared at each other.\n","\n","âBlimey,â whispered Ron. âYou donât reckon â¦ he hasnât found â¦?â\n","\n","âBetter go and see, hadnât I?â said Harry, jumping to his feet.\n","\n","He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harryâs defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.\n","\n","And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.\n","\n","âHow - dare - you - aaaaargh!â\n","\n","The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted towards it, his wand at the ready, hurtled round another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.\n","\n","âProfessor -â\n","\n","Harry hurried forwards and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccoughed loudly, patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harryâs helping arm.\n","\n","âWhat happened, Professor?â\n","\n","âYou may well ask!â she said shrilly. âI was strolling along, brooding upon certain Dark portents 1 happen to have glimpsed â¦â\n","\n","But Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: there on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and, on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed -\n","\n","âProfessor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?â\n","\n","ââ¦ omens I have been vouchsafed - what?â\n","\n","She looked suddenly shifty.\n","\n","The Room of Requirement,â repeated Harry. âWere you trying to get in there?â\n","\n","âI - well - I didnât know students knew about -â\n","\n","âNot all of them do,â said Harry. âBut what happened? You screamed â¦ it sounded as though you were hurtâ¦â\n","\n","âI - well,â said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. âI wished to - ah - deposit certain â um - personal items in the Room â¦â And she muttered something about ânasty accusationsâ.\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. âBut you couldnât get in and hide them?â\n","\n","He found this very odd; the Room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the HalfBlood Princeâs book.\n","\n","âOh, I got in all right,â said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. âBut there was somebody already in there.â\n","\n","âSomebody in -? Who?â demanded Harry. âWho was in there?â\n","\n","â ? have no idea,â said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harryâs voice. âI walked into the Room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding - of using the Room, I mean.â\n","\n","âA voice? Saying what?â\n","\n","âI donât know that it was saying anything,â said Professor Trelawney. âIt was â¦ whooping.â\n","\n","âWhooping?â\n","\n","âGleefully,â she said, nodding.\n","\n","Harry stared at her.\n","\n","âWas it male or female?â\n","\n","â ? would hazard a guess at male,â said Professor Trelawney.\n","\n","âAnd it sounded happy?â\n","\n","âVery happy,â said Professor Trelawney sniffily.\n","\n","âAs though it was celebrating?â\n","\n","âMost definitely.â\n","\n","âAnd then -?â\n","\n","âAnd then I called out, âWhoâs there?ââ\n","\n","âYou couldnât have found out who it was without asking?â Harry asked her, slightly frustrated.\n","\n","âThe Inner Eye,â said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, âwas fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawneyâs Inner Eye all too often before. âAnd did the voice say who was there?â\n","\n","âNo, it did not,â she said. âEverything went pitch black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the Room!â\n","\n","âAnd you didnât see that coming?â said Harry, unable to help himself.\n","\n","âNo, I did not, as I say, it was pitch -â She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.\n","\n","âI think youâd better tell Professor Dumbledore,â said Harry. âHe ought to know Malfoyâs celebrating - I mean, that someone threw you out of the Room.â\n","\n","To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.\n","\n","The Headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,â she said coldly. I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show -â\n","\n","Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harryâs wrist.\n","\n","âAgain and again, no matter how I lay them out -â\n","\n","And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls.\n","\n","â- the lightningstruck tower,â she whispered. âCalamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time â¦â\n","\n","âRight,â said Harry again. âWell â¦ I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the Room â¦â\n","\n","âYou think so?â Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.\n","\n","âIâm going to see him right now,â said Harry. âIâve got a meeting with him. We could go together.â\n","\n","âOh, well, in that case,â said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche.\n","\n","âI miss having you in my classes, Harry,â she said soulfully, as they set off together. âYou were never much of a Seer â¦ but you were a wonderful Objectâ¦â\n","\n","Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawneyâs continual predictions of doom.\n","\n","âI am afraid,â she went on, âthat the nag - Iâm sorry, the centaur - knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him - one Seer to another - had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!â\n","\n","Her voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.\n","\n","âPerhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my greatgreatgrandmotherâs gift. Those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?â\n","\n","Harry mumbled something indistinct.\n","\n","âI well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,â went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. âHe was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed â¦ I was staying at the Hogâs Head, which I do not advise, incidentally - bed bugs, dear boy - but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn. He questioned me â¦ I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed illdisposed towards Divination â¦ and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day â¦ but then â¦â\n","\n","And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort.\n","\n","ââ¦ but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!â\n","\n","âWhat?â\n","\n","âYes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although Iâm afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore - you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes - Harry, dear?â\n","\n","She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realised that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.\n","\n","âHarry?â she repeated uncertainly.\n","\n","Perhaps his face was white, to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stockstill as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long â¦\n","\n","It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son â¦\n","\n","Nothing else mattered to Harry just now.\n","\n","âHarry?â said Professor Trelawney again. âHarry - I thought we were going to see the Headmaster together?â\n","\n","âYou stay here,â said Harry through numb lips.\n","\n","âBut, dear â¦ I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of-â\n","\n","âYou stay here!â Harry repeated angrily.\n","\n","She looked alarmed as he ran past her, round the corner into Dumbledoreâs corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledoreâs door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered âEnterâ after Harry had already flung himself into the room.\n","\n","Fawkes the phoenix looked round, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window. Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black travelling cloak in his arms.\n","\n","âWell, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.â\n","\n","For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.\n","\n","âCome â¦ with you â¦ ?â\n","\n","âOnly if you wish it, of course.â\n","\n","âIf Iâ¦â\n","\n","And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledoreâs office in the first place.\n","\n","âYouâve found one? Youâve found a Horcrux?â\n","\n","âI believe so.â\n","\n","Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: for several moments, Harry could not speak.\n","\n","âIt is natural to be afraid,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âIâm not scared!â said Harry at once, and it was perfectly\n","\n","true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. âWhich Horcrux is it? Where is it?â\n","\n","âI am not sure which it is - though I think we can rule out the snake - but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry. âHow is it protected?â\n","\n","âI do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.â Dumbledore hesitated, then said, âHarry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.â\n","\n","âIâm coming,â said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Harryâs face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window, and looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.\n","\n","âWhat has happened to you?â\n","\n","âNothing,â lied Harry promptly.\n","\n","âWhat has upset you?â\n","\n","âIâm not upset.â\n","\n","âHarry, you were never a good Occlumens -â\n","\n","The word was the spark that ignited Harryâs fury.\n","\n","âSnape!â he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. âSnapeâs whatâs happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!â\n","\n","Dumbledoreâs expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing.\n","\n","âWhen did you find out about this?â he asked at last.\n","\n","âJust now!â said Many, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. âAND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!â\n","\n","Breathing hard as though he were fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger â¦\n","\n","âHarry,â said Dumbledore quietly. âPlease listen to me.â\n","\n","It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledoreâs lined face.\n","\n","âProfessor Snape made a terrible -â\n","\n","âDonât tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!â\n","\n","âPlease let me finish.â Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on. âProfessor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemortâs employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawneyâs prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know - he had no possible way of knowing - which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onwards, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father -â\n","\n","Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.\n","\n","âHe hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Havenât you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?â\n","\n","âYou have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realised how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned -â\n","\n","âBut heâs a very good Occlumens, isnât he, sir?â said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. âAnd isnât Voldemort convinced that Snapeâs on his side, even now? Professor â¦ how can you be sure Snapeâs on our side?â\n","\n","Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, âI am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.â\n","\n","Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.\n","\n","âWell, I donât!â he said, as loudly as before. âHeâs up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still -â\n","\n","âWe have discussed this, Harry,â said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. âI have told you my views.â\n","\n","âYouâre leaving the school tonight and Iâll bet you havenât even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to -â\n","\n","To what?â asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. âWhat is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?â\n","\n","âI â¦ theyâre up to something!â said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it. âProfessor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! Heâs trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me heâs fixed it at last and youâre about to just walk out of school * without -â\n","\n","âEnough,â said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. âDo you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.â\n","\n","âI didnât -â mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.\n","\n","â ? do not wish to discuss the matter any further.â\n","\n","Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, âDo you wish to come with me tonight?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry at once.\n","\n","âVery well, then: listen.â\n","\n","Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height.\n","\n","âI take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.â\n","\n","âOf course.â\n","\n","âBe sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such orders as ârunâ, âhideâ or âgo backâ. Do I have your word?â\n","\n","âI - yes, of course.â\n","\n","âIf 1 tell you to hide, you will do so?â\n","\n","âYes.â\n","\n","âIf I tell you to flee, you will obey?â\n","\n","âYes.â\n","\n","âIf I tell you to leave me, and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?â\n","\n","âI -â\n","\n","âHarry?â\n","\n","They looked at each other for a moment.\n","\n","âYes, sir.â\n","\n","âVery good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Cloak and meet me in the Entrance Hall in five minutesâ time.â\n","\n","Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a rubyred glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.\n","\n","Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. âWhat does Dumbledore want?â Hermione said at once. âHarry, are you OK?â she added anxiously.\n","\n","âIâm fine,â said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauderâs Map and a pair of balledup socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned.\n","\n","âI havenât got much time,â Harry panted, âDumbledore thinks Iâm getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen â¦â\n","\n","Quickly he told them where he was going, and why. He did not pause either for Hermioneâs gasps of horror or for Ronâs hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.\n","\n","ââ¦ so you see what this means?â Harry finished at a gallop. âDumbledore wonât be here tonight, so Malfoyâs going to have another clear shot at whatever heâs up to. No, listen to me!â he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. âI know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here -â He shoved the Marauderâs Map into Hermioneâs hand. âYouâve got to watch him and youâve got to watch Snape, too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA. Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says heâs put extra protection in the school, but if Snapeâs involved, heâll know what Dumbledoreâs protection is, and how to avoid it - but he wonât be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?â\n","\n","âHarry -â began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.\n","\n","â ? havenât got time to argue,â said Harry curtly. Take this as well -â He thrust the socks into Ronâs hands.\n","\n","âThanks,â said Ron. âEr - why do I need socks?â\n","\n","âYou need whatâs wrapped in them, itâs the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say goodbye to her from me. Iâd better go, Dumbledoreâs waiting -â\n","\n","âNo!â said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. âWe donât want it, you take it, who knows what youâre going to be facing?â\n","\n","âIâIl be fine, Iâll be with Dumbledore,â said Harry. âI want to know you lot are OK â¦ donât look like that, Hermione, Iâll see you later\n","\n","And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall.\n","\n","Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.\n","\n","âI would like you to wear your Cloak, please,â said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, âVery good. Shall we go?â\n","\n","Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot.\n","\n","âBut what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?â Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape.\n","\n","That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,â said Dumbledore lightly. âI sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hogâs Head â¦ or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising oneâs true destination.â\n","\n","They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water and wood smoke from Hagridâs cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.\n","\n","âProfessor,â said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, âwill we be Apparating?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore. âYou can Apparate now, I believe?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry, âbut I havenât got a licence.â\n","\n","He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?\n","\n","âNo matter,â said Dumbledore, âI can assist you again.â\n","\n","They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.\n","\n","â- and stay out!â shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubbylooking wizard. âOh, hello, Albus â¦ youâre out late â¦â\n","\n","âGood evening, Rosmerta, good evening â¦ forgive me, Iâm off to the Hogâs Head â¦ no offence, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonightâ¦â\n","\n","A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hogâs Headâs sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty.\n","\n","âIt will not be necessary for us to enter,â muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. âAs long as nobody sees us go â¦ now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three - one â¦ two â¦ three â¦â\n","\n","Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 26: The Cave\n","\n","\n","Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and starstrewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.\n","\n","âWhat do you think?â asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harryâs opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.\n","\n","âThey brought the kids from the orphanage here?â asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.\n","\n","âNot here, precisely,â said Dumbledore. âThere is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, donât you?â\n","\n","Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.\n","\n","âBut his final destination â and ours â lies a little farther on. Come.â\n","\n","Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay halfsubmerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face. âLumos,â said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. âYou see?â said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling. âYou will not object to getting a little wet?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry.\n","\n","âThen take off your Invisibility Cloak â there is no need for it now â and let us take the plunge,â And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed. The water was icy; Harryâs waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff. The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledoreâs wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledoreâs wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.\n","\n","Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.\n","\n","Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.\n","\n","âYes, this is the place,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","âHow can you tell?â Harry spoke in a whisper.\n","\n","âIt has known magic,â said Dumbledore simply. Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spinedeep coldness or to the same awareness of\n","\n","enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see. âThis is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,â said Dumbledore after a moment or two. âWe need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemortâs obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . .â\n","\n","Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall. âHere,â he said. âWe go on through here. The entrance is concealed.â Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.\n","\n","âYouâve ddone it!â said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.\n","\n","âHarry, Iâm so sorry, I forgot,â he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harryâs clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.\n","\n","âThank you,â said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledores concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, âOh, surely not. So crude.â\n","\n","âWhat is it, Professor?â\n","\n","âI rather think,â said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, âthat we are required to make payment to pass.â\n","\n","âPayment?â said Harry. âYouâve got to give the door something?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore. âBlood, if I am not much mistaken.â\n","\n","âBlood?â\n","\n","âI said it was crude,â said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of higher standards Dumbledore expected. âThe idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.â\n","\n","âYeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .â said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more.\n","\n","âSometimes, however, it is unavoidable,â said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.\n","\n","âProfessor!â protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. âIâll do it, Iâm ââ He did not know what he was going to say â younger, fitter?\n","\n","But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops.\n","\n","âYou are very kind, Harry,â said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoyâs wound, âBut your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesnât it?â The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The bloodspattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness. âAfter me, I think,â said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.\n","\n","An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.\n","\n","âLet us walk,â said Dumbledore quietly. âBe very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.â He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.\n","\n","âProfessor?â he said finally. âDo you think the Horcrux is here?â\n","\n","âOh yes,â said Dumbledore. âYes, Iâm sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?â\n","\n","âWe couldnâtâ¦ we couldnât just try a Summoning Charm?â Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.\n","\n","âCertainly we could,â said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. âWhy donât you do it?â\n","\n","âMe? Oh . . . okay . . .â Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, âAccio Horcrux!â\n","\n","With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.\n","\n","âWhat was that?â\n","\n","âSomething, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.â\n","\n","Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harryâs heart, however, was still pounding.\n","\n","âDid you think that would happen, sir?â\n","\n","âI thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.â\n","\n","âBut we donât know what the thing was,â said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water.\n","\n","âWhat the things are, you mean,â said Dumbledore. âI doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?â\n","\n","âProfessor?â\n","\n","âYes, Harry?â\n","\n","âDo you think weâre going to have to go into the lake?â\n","\n","âInto it? Only if we are very unfortunate.â\n","\n","âYou donât think the Horcrux is at the bottom?â\n","\n","âOh no â¦ I think the Horcrux is in the middle.â And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake.\n","\n","âSo weâre going to have to cross the lake to get to it?â\n","\n","âYes, I think so.â Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . .\n","\n","âAha,â said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledoreâs uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. âSo sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.â\n","\n","Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but t hrough the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.\n","\n","âOho,â said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledoreâs buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.\n","\n","Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledoreâs clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.\n","\n","âHow did you know that was there?â Harry asked in astonishment.\n","\n","âMagic always leaves traces,â said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, âsometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.â\n","\n","âIs â¦ is this boat safe?â\n","\n","âOh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.â\n","\n","âSo the things in the water wonât do anything to us if we cross in Voldemortâs boat?â\n","\n","âI think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.â\n","\n","âBut why have they let us?â asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.\n","\n","âVoldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,â said Dumbledore. âI think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he was right.â\n","\n","Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small. âIt doesnât look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?â\n","\n","Dumbledore chuckled. âVoldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.â\n","\n","âBut then â ?â\n","\n","âI do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteenyearold to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.â These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, âVoldemortâs mistake, Harry, Voldemortâs mistake. . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.â Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boatâs prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.\n","\n","Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . .\n","\n","And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface. âProfessor!â he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.\n","\n","âHarry?â\n","\n","âI think I saw a hand in the water â a human hand!â\n","\n","âYes, I am sure you did,â said Dumbledore calmly.\n","\n","Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.\n","\n","âSo that thing that jumped out of the water â ?â But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke. âThere are bodies in here!â said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own.\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore placidly, âbut we do not need to worry about them at the moment.â\n","\n","âAt the moment?â Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore.\n","\n","âNot while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,â said Dumbledore. âThere is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.â Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.\n","\n","âBut one of them jumped,â he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledoreâs. âWhen I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.â\n","\n","âYes,â said Dumbledore. âI am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,â Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harryâs bewildered expression.\n","\n","âOh . . . right. . .â said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead â¦ It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to them . . . and he hadnât seen Ginny at all. . .\n","\n","âNearly there,â said Dumbledore cheerfully. Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake. âCareful not to touch the water,â said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat.\n","\n","The island was no larger than Dumbledoreâs office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal. Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow.\n","\n","âWhat is it?â asked Harry quietly.\n","\n","âI am not sure,â said Dumbledore. âSomething more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.â Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.\n","\n","âSir, no, donât touch â !â\n","\n","âI cannot touch,â said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. âSee? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.â\n","\n","Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air.\n","\n","âOut of the way, please, Harry,â said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of thepotion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.\n","\n","âYou think the Horcrux is in there, sir?â\n","\n","âOh yes.â Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. âBut how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.â Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. âI can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.â\n","\n","âWhat?â said Harry. âNo!â\n","\n","âYes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.â\n","\n","âBut what ifâ what if it kills you?â\n","\n","âOh, I doubt that it would work like that,â said Dumbledore easily. âLord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.â Harry couldnât believe it. Was this more of Dumbledoreâs insane determination to see good in everyone?\n","\n","âSir,â said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, âsir, this is Voldemort weâre ââ\n","\n","âIâm sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,â Dumbledore corrected himself. âHe would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.â\n","\n","Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. âUndoubtedly,â he said, finally, âthis potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?â\n","\n","Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along â so that he could forcefeed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?\n","\n","âYou remember,â said Dumbledore, âthe condition on which I brought you with me?â\n","\n","Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.\n","\n","âBut what ifâ?â\n","\n","âYou swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?â\n","\n","âYes, butââ\n","\n","âI warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry, âbut ââ\n","\n","âWell, then,â said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, âyou have my orders.â\n","\n","âWhy canât I drink the potion instead?â asked Harry desperately.\n","\n","âBecause I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,â said Dumbledore. âOnce and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?â\n","\n","âCouldnât â ?â\n","\n","âDo I have it?â\n","\n","âButââ\n","\n","âYour word, Harry.â\n","\n","âI âall right, butââ\n","\n","Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth. âYour good health, Harry.â\n","\n","And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.\n","\n","âProfessor?â he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. âHow do you feel?â\n","\n","Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.\n","\n","In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.\n","\n","âProfessor Dumbledore?â said Harry, his voice strained. âCan you hear me?â\n","\n","Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady. âProfessor, can you hear me?â he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern.\n","\n","Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this.\n","\n","âI donât want. . . Donât make me â¦â\n","\n","Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and halfmoon spectacles, and did not know what to do.\n","\n","â. . . donât like . . . want to stop . . .â moaned Dumbledore.\n","\n","âYou . . . you canât stop, Professor,â said Harry. âYouâve got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . .â Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledoreâs mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.\n","\n","âNo â¦â he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. âI donât want to. â¦ I donât want to. . . . Let me go. . . .â\n","\n","âIts all right, Professor,â said Harry, his hand shaking. âIts all right, Iâm here ââ\n","\n","âMake it stop, make it stop,â moaned Dumbledore.\n","\n","âYes.. . yes, thisâll make it stop,â lied Harry. He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledoreâs open mouth. Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water.\n","\n","âNo, no, no, no, I canât, I canât, donât make me, I donât warn to. . . .â\n","\n","âItâs all right, Professor, itâs all right!â said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth goblei ful of potion; the basin was now half empty. âNothingâs happening to you, youâre safe, it isnât real, I swear it isnât real â take this, now, take thisâ¦â And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.\n","\n","âIts all my fault, all my fault,â he sobbed. âPlease make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and Iâll never, never again â¦â\n","\n","âThis will make it stop, Professor,â Harry said, his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledoreâs mouth.\n","\n","Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harryâs trembling hands as he moaned, âDonât hurt them, donât hurt them, please, please, its my fault, hurt me instead â¦â\n","\n","âHere, drink this, drink this, youâll be all right,â said Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet.\n","\n","âPlease, please, please, no â¦ not that, not that, Iâll do anything â¦â\n","\n","âJust drink, Professor, just drink . . .â\n","\n","Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. âNo more, please, no more â¦â\n","\n","Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin. âWeâre nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. â¦â\n","\n","He supported Dumbledoreâs shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, âI want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!â\n","\n","âDrink this, Professor. Drink this. . . .â\n","\n","Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, âKILL ME!â\n","\n","âThis â this one will!â gasped Harry. âJust drink this .. . Itâll be over â¦ all over!â Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.\n","\n","âNo!â shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledoreâs glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. âNo.â said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, âno, youâre not dead, you said it wasnât poison, wake up, wake up â Rennervate!â he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledores chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. âRennervate â sir â please ââ\n","\n","Dumbledores eyelids flickered; Harryâs heart leapt, âSir, are you â ?â\n","\n","âWater,â croaked Dumbledore.\n","\n","âWater,â panted Harry. âYes ââ He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it.\n","\n","âAguamenti!â he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand. The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips â but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. âBut I had some â wait â Aguamenti!â said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledores mouth, the water vanished again. âSir, Iâm trying, Iâm trying!â said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. âAguamenti âAguamenti âAGUAMENTI!â\n","\n","The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledores breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so â¦ He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish. âSir â here!â Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face.\n","\n","It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirrorsmooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.\n","\n","âPetrificus Totalus!â yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm. It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.\n","\n","âPetrificus Totalus!â Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. âImpedimenta! Incarcerous!â A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, âSectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!â But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshlcv. arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, anil he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soulâ¦\n","\n","But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, then scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around.\n","\n","Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth. The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . .\n","\n","Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.\n","\n","Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.\n","\n","âSir,â panted Harry, âsir, I forgot â about fire â they were coming at me and I panicked ââ\n","\n","âQuite understandable,â murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.\n","\n","They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.\n","\n","âI am weakâ¦â he said.\n","\n","âDonât worry, sir,â said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledoreâs extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. âDonât worry, Iâll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .â\n","\n","And pulling Dumbledoreâs uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.\n","\n","âThe protection was . . . after allâ¦ welldesigned,â said Dumbledore faintly. âOne alone could not have done it. â¦ You did well, very well, Harry. â¦â\n","\n","âDonât talk now,â said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledoreâs voice had become, how much his feet dragged. âSave your energy, sir. . . . Weâll soon be out of here. . . .â\n","\n","âThe archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife â¦â â\n","\n","âThereâs no need, I got cut on the rock,â said Harry firmly. âJust tell me where. . . .â\n","\n","âHere . . .â\n","\n","Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having received its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.\n","\n","âItâs going to be all right, sir,â Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledoreâs silence than he had been by his weakened voice. âWeâre nearly there. â¦ I can Apparate us both back . . . Donât worry. . . .â\n","\n","âI am not worried, Harry,â said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. âI am with you.â\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 27: The Lightning-Struck Tower\n","\n","\n","Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledoreâs weight still upon him, Harry con centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledoreâs arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression.\n","\n","He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harryâs imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.\n","\n","âWe did it, Professor!â Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest. âWe did it! We got the Horcrux!â\n","\n","Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore offbalance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.\n","\n","âSir, are you all right?â\n","\n","âIâve been better,â said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. That potion â¦ was no health drink â¦â\n","\n","And to Harryâs horror, Dumbledore sank on to the ground.\n","\n","âSir - itâs OK, sir, youâre going to be all right, donât worry -â\n","\n","He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.\n","\n","âWe need to get you up to the school, sir â¦ Madam Pomfrey â¦â\n","\n","âNo,â said Dumbledore. âIt is â¦ Professor Snape whom I need â¦ but I do not think â¦ I can walk very far just yet â¦â\n","\n","âRight - sir, listen - Iâm going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam -â\n","\n","âSeverus,â said Dumbledore clearly. âI need Severus â¦â\n","\n","âAll right then, Snape - but Iâm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can -â\n","\n","Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard run ning footsteps. His heart leapt: somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on highheeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressinggown embroidered with dragons.\n","\n","âI saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldnât think what to - but whatâs wrong with Albus?â\n","\n","She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wideeyed, at Dumbledore.\n","\n","âHeâs hurt,â said Harry. âMadam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?â\n","\n","âYou canât go up there alone! Donât you realise - havenât you seen -?â\n","\n","âIf you help me support him,â said Harry, not listening to her, âI think we can get him inside -â\n","\n","âWhat has happened?â asked Dumbledore. âRosmerta, whatâs wrong?â\n","\n","The - the Dark Mark, Albus.â\n","\n","And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words â¦ he turned and looked.\n","\n","There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building â¦ wherever they had murdered â¦\n","\n","âWhen did it appear?â asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harryâs shoulder as he struggled to his feet.\n","\n","âMust have been minutes ago, it wasnât there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs -â\n","\n","âWe need to return to the castle at once,â said Dumbledore. âRosmerta,â and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation, âwe need transport - brooms -â\n","\n","âIâve got a couple behind the bar,â she said, looking very frightened. âShall I run and fetch -?â\n","\n","âNo, Harry can do it.â\n","\n","Harry raised his wand at once.\n","\n","âAccio Rosmertaâs brooms.â\n","\n","A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harryâs side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height.\n","\n","âRosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,â said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. âIt might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong â¦ Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.â\n","\n","Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind â¦\n","\n","How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginnyâs luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the DA? And if it was â¦ he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds â¦ would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?\n","\n","As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?\n","\n","Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around.\n","\n","The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.\n","\n","âWhat does it mean?â Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpentâs tongue glinting evilly above them. âIs it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been - Professor?â\n","\n","In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand.\n","\n","âGo and wake Severus,â said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do noth ing else, speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.â\n","\n","âBut -â\n","\n","âYou swore to obey me, Harry - go!â\n","\n","Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked round at Dumbledore, who gestured to him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.\n","\n","The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted: âExpelliarmus!â\n","\n","Harryâs body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm -\n","\n","Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledoreâs wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood â¦ Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.\n","\n","Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, âGood evening, Draco.â\n","\n","Malfoy stepped forwards, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.\n","\n","âWho else is here?â\n","\n","âA question 1 might ask you. Or are you acting alone?â\n","\n","Harry saw Malfoyâs pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.\n","\n","âNo,â he said. âIâve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.â\n","\n","âWell, well,â said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was show ing him an ambitious homework project. âVery good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Malfoy, who was panting. âRight under your nose and you never realised!â\n","\n","âIngenious,â said Dumbledore. âYet â¦ forgive me â¦ where are they now? You seem unsupported.â\n","\n","They met some of your guard. Theyâre having a fight down below. They wonât be long â¦ I came on ahead. I - Iâve got a job to do.â\n","\n","âWell, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,â said Dumbledore softly.\n","\n","There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralysed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eatersâ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who, incredibly, smiled.\n","\n","âDraco, Draco, you are not a killer.â\n","\n","âHow do you know?â said Malfoy at once.\n","\n","He seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Markâs greenish light.\n","\n","âYou donât know what Iâm capable of,â said Malfoy more forcefully, âyou donât know what Iâve done!â\n","\n","âOh, yes, I do,â said Dumbledore mildly. âYou almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts â¦ so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in itâ¦â\n","\n","âIt has been in it!â said Malfoy vehemently. âIâve been work ing on it all year, and tonight -â\n","\n","Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.\n","\n","âSomebody is putting up a good fight,â said Dumbledore conversationally. âBut you were saying â¦ yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible â¦ how did you do it?â\n","\n","But Malfoy said nothing: he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was.\n","\n","âPerhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,â suggested Dumbledore. âWhat if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realised, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you donât really need help â¦ I have no wand at the moment â¦ I cannot defend myself.â\n","\n","Malfoy merely stared at him.\n","\n","âI see,â said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither\n","\n","moved nor spoke. âYou are afraid to act until they join\n","\n","you.âÂ»\n","\n","âIâm not afraid!â snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. âItâs you who should be scared!â\n","\n","âBut why? I donât think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe â¦ so tell me, while we wait for your friends â¦ how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.â\n","\n","Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latterâs heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, â1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no oneâs used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.â\n","\n","âAaaah.â\n","\n","Dumbledoreâs sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment.\n","\n","That was clever â¦ there is a pair, I take it?â\n","\n","âThe otherâs in Borgin and Burkes,â said Malfoy, âand they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was travelling between them, but he couldnât make anyone hear him â¦ in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though heâd never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin didnât know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.â\n","\n","âVery good,â murmured Dumbledore. âSo the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you â¦ a clever plan, a very clever plan â¦ and, as you say, right under my nose â¦â\n","\n","âYeah,â said Malfoy who, bizarrely, seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledoreâs praise. âYeah, it was!â\n","\n","âBut there were times,â Dumbledore went on, âwerenât there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands â¦ poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink â¦â\n","\n","âYeah, well, you still didnât realise who was behind that stuff, did you?â sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him.\n","\n","âAs a matter of fact, I did,â said Dumbledore. âI was sure it was you.â\n","\n","âWhy didnât you stop me, then?â Malfoy demanded.\n","\n","âI tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders -â\n","\n","âHe hasnât been doing your orders, he promised my mother -â\n","\n","âOf course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but -â\n","\n","âHeâs a doubleagent, you stupid old man, he isnât working for you, you just think he is!â\n","\n","âWe must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape -â\n","\n","âWell, youâre losing your grip, then!â sneered Malfoy. âHeâs been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the action - âWhat are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything -â But I havenât told him what Iâve been doing in the Room of Requirement, heâs going to wake up tomorrow and itâll all be over and he wonât be the Dark Lordâs favourite any more, heâll be nothing compared to me, nothing!â\n","\n","âVery gratifying,â said Dumbledore mildly. âWe all like* appreciation for our own hard work, of course â¦ but you must have had an accomplice, all the same â¦ someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah\n","\n","Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.\n","\n","ââ¦ of course â¦ Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?â\n","\n","âGot there at last, have you?â Malfoy taunted.\n","\n","There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on, âSo poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead â¦ well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present â¦ yes, very neat â¦ very neat â¦ poor Mr Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmertaâs â¦ tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.â\n","\n","âEnchanted coins,â said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. âI had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages -â\n","\n","âIsnât that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledoreâs Army used last year?â asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.\n","\n","âYeah, I got the idea from them,â said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. âI got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions â¦â\n","\n","Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah\n","\n","Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep.\n","\n","ââ¦ of course â¦ Rosmerta.

We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted â¦â\n","\n","Malfoyâs mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter.\n","\n","âNow, about tonight,â Dumbledore went on, âI am a little puzzled about how it happened â¦ you knew that I had left the school? But of course,â he answered his own question, âRosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, Iâm sure â¦â\n","\n","âThatâs right,â said Malfoy. âBut she said you were just going for a drink, youâd be back â¦â\n","\n","âWell, I certainly did have a drink â¦ and I came back â¦ after a fashion,â mumbled Dumbledore. âSo you decided to spring a trap for me?â\n","\n","âWe decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here, to see whoâd been killed,â said Malfoy. âAnd it worked!â\n","\n","âWell â¦ yes and no â¦â said Dumbledore. âBut am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?â\n","\n","âSomeoneâs dead,â said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. âOne of your people â¦ I donât know who, it was dark â¦ I stepped over the body â¦ I was* supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way â¦â\n","\n","âYes, they do that,â said Dumbledore.\n","\n","There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy and Harry stood, and Harryâs heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest â¦ someone was dead â¦ Malfoy had stepped over the body â¦ but who was it?\n","\n","There is little time, one way or another,â said Dumbledore. âSo let us discuss your options, Draco.â\n","\n","âMy options!â said Malfoy loudly. âIâm standing here with a wand - Iâm about to kill you -â\n","\n","âMy dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first Disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.â\n","\n","âI havenât got any options!â said Malfoy, and he was sud denly as white as Dumbledore. âIâve got to do it! Heâll kill me! Heâll kill my whole family!â\n","\n","âI appreciate the difficulty of your position,â said Dumbledore. âWhy else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you.â\n","\n","Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.\n","\n","âI did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,â continued Dumbledore. âBut now at last we can speak plainly to each other â¦ no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived â¦ I can help you, Draco.â\n","\n","âNo, you canât,â said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. âNobody can. He told me to do it or heâll kill me. Iâve got no choice.â\n","\n","âCome over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban â¦ when the time comes we can protect him too â¦ come over to the right side, Draco â¦ you are not a killer â¦â\n","\n","Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.\n","\n","âBut I got this far, didnât I?â he said slowly. They thought Iâd die in the attempt, but Iâm here â¦ and youâre in my power â¦ Iâm the one with the wand â¦ youâre at my mercy â¦â\n","\n","âNo, Draco,â said Dumbledore quietly. âIt is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.â\n","\n","Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction -\n","\n","But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ramparts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.\n","\n","A lumpylooking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.\n","\n","âDumbledore cornered!â he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. âDumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!â\n","\n","âGood evening, Amycus,â said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. âAnd youâve brought Alecto too â¦ charming â¦â\n","\n","The woman gave an angry little titter.\n","\n","Think your little jokesâll help you on your death bed, then?â she jeered.\n","\n","âJokes? No, no, these are manners,â replied Dumbledore.\n","\n","âDo it,â said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eaterâs robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.\n","\n","âIs that you, Fenrir?â asked Dumbledore.\n","\n","Thatâs right,â rasped the other. âPleased to see me, Dumbledore?â\n","\n","âNo, I cannot say that I am â¦â\n","\n","Fenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.\n","\n","âBut you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.â\n","\n","âAm I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual â¦ you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?â\n","\n","Thatâs right,â said Greyback. âShocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?â\n","\n","âWell, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,â said Dumbledore. âAnd, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends liveâ¦â\n","\n","âI didnât,â breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. âI didnât know he was going to come -â\n","\n","âI wouldnât want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,â rasped Greyback. âNot when there are throats to be ripped out â¦ delicious, delicious â¦â\n","\n","And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore.\n","\n","â1 could do you for afters, Dumbledore â¦â\n","\n","âNo,â said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutallooking face. âWeâve got orders. Dracoâs got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.â\n","\n","Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledoreâs face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.\n","\n","âHeâs not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!â said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sisterâs wheezing giggles. âLook at him - whatâs happened to you, then, Dumby?â\n","\n","âOh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,â said Dumbledore. âOld age, in short â¦ one day, perhaps, it will happen to you â¦ if you are lucky â¦â\n","\n","âWhatâs that mean, then, whatâs that mean?â yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. âAlways the same, werenât yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I donât even know why the Dark Lordâs bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!â\n","\n","But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, âTheyâve blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO!â\n","\n","Harryâs heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them -\n","\n","âNow, Draco, quickly!â said the brutalfaced man angrily.\n","\n","But Malfoyâs hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.\n","\n","Til do it,â snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.\n","\n","âI said no!â shouted the brutalfaced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harryâs heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledoreâs spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak -\n","\n","âDraco, do it, or stand aside so one of us -â screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.\n","\n","âWeâve got a problem, Snape,â said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, âthe boy doesnât seem able -â\n","\n","But somebody else had spoken Snapeâs name, quite softly.\n","\n","âSeverus â¦â\n","\n","The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.\n","\n","Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.\n","\n","Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.\n","\n","âSeverus â¦ please â¦â\n","\n","Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.\n","\n","âAvada Kedavra!â\n","\n","A jet of green light shot from the end of Snapeâs wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harryâs scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 28: Flight of the Prince\n","\n","\n","Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. â¦\n","\n","âOut of here, quickly,â said Snape.\n","\n","He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutalfaced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.\n","\n","âPetrificus Totalus!â\n","\n","The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.\n","\n","Terror tore at Harry;s heart. â¦ He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. â¦ Somehow the two things were linked. â¦ He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. â¦ Dumbledore could not have died. â¦\n","\n","He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, âItâs over, time to go!â and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -\n","\n","âPetrificus Totalus!â\n","\n","Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: âCrucio - Crucio - you canât dance forever, pretty-â\n","\n","âImpedimenta!â yelled Harry.\n","\n","His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -\n","\n","âHarry, where did you come from?â Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -\n","\n","âTake that!â shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someoneâs legs. Looking around, he saw Nevilleâs pale, round face flat against the floor. âNeville, are you - ?â\n","\n","âMâall right,â muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, âHarry . . . Snape ânâ Malfoy . . . ran past. . .â\n","\n","âI know, Iâm on it!â said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .\n","\n","He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors - perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked -\n","\n","He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .\n","\n","He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajamaclad Hufflepuffs stood.\n","\n","âHarry! We heard a noise, and someone said something aboui the Dark Mark -â began Ernie Macmillan.\n","\n","âOut of the way!â yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.\n","\n","Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate - by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy. â¦\n","\n","The cold night air ripped at Harryâs lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse -\n","\n","Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid. . . not Hagrid too . . .\n","\n","Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .\n","\n","âImpedimenta!â he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.\n","\n","And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate -\n","\n","Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snapeâs back, and yelled, âStupefy!â\n","\n","He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snapeâs head; Snape shouted, âRun, Draco!âand turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.\n","\n","âCruc - â\n","\n","But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, âIncendio!â Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagridâs house was on fire.\n","\n","âFangâs in there, yer evil - !â Hagrid bellowed.\n","\n","âCruc -â yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.\n","\n","âNo Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!â he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagridâs yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. âYou havenât got the nerve or the ability -â\n","\n","âIncarc-âHarry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.\n","\n","âFight back!â Harry screamed at him. âFight back, you cowardlyâââ\n","\n","âCoward, did you call me, Potter?â shouted Snape. âYour father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?â âStupe-â\n","\n","âBlocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!â sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. âNow come!â he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. âIt is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up -â\n","\n","âImpedi -â\n","\n","But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness -\n","\n","âNo!â roared Snapeâs voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, âHave you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord - we are to leave him! Go! Go!â\n","\n","And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\n","\n","âSectum - â\n","\n","Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snapeâs face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\n","\n","âNo, Potter!â screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, ;un\\ this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore hadl been. Snapeâs pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.\n","\n","âYou dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the HalfBlood Prince! And youâd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I donât think so . . . noâ\n","\n","Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.\n","\n","âKill me then,â panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. âKill me like you killed him, you coward -â\n","\n","âDONâT -â screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them - âCALL ME COWARD!â\n","\n","And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a whitehot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razorsharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech -\n","\n","Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the schoolâs boundaries.\n","\n","âHagrid,â muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. âHAGRID?â\n","\n","He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\n","\n","âYeh all righâ, Harry? Yeh all righâ? Speak ter me, Harry. . ..â\n","\n","Hagrids huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fangâs reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\n","\n","âIâm all right,â panted Harry. âAre you?â ââCourse I am . . . take moreân that ter finish me.â\n","\n","Hagrid put his hands under Harryâs arms and raised him up with such force that Harryâs feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagridâs cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\n","\n","âWe should put out your house,â said Harry, âthe charmâs âAguamentiâ â¦â\n","\n","âKnew it was summat like that,â mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, âAguamenti!â\n","\n","A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured âAguamentiâ too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\n","\n","âSânot too bad,â said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. âNothin Dumbledore wonâ be able to put righâ . . .â\n","\n","Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\n","\n","âHagrid â¦â\n","\n","âI was bindinâ up a couple oâ bowtruckle legs when I heard âem coming,â said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. âTheyâll bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .â\n","\n","âHagrid . . .â\n","\n","âBut what happened, Harry? I jusâ saw them Death Eaters runnin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doinâ with âem? Whereâs he gone - was he chasinâ them?â\n","\n","âHe . . .â Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. âHagrid, he killed . . .â\n","\n","âKilled?â said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. âSnape killed? Whatâre yeh on abouâ, Harry?â\n","\n","âDumbledore,â said Harry. âSnape killed .. . Dumbledore.â\n","\n","Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\n","\n","âDumbledore wha, Harry?â\n","\n","âHeâs dead. Snape killed himâ¦.â\n","\n","âDonâ say that,â said Hagrid roughly. âSnape kill Dumbledore - donâ be stupid, Harry. Whaâs made yeh say thaâ?â\n","\n","âI saw it happen.â , ,..\n","\n","âYeh couldnâ have.â\n","\n","âI saw it, Hagrid.â\n","\n","Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. â¦\n","\n","âWhat musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,â Hagrid said confidently. âI suppose heâs gotta keep his cover. Look, letâs get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. â¦â\n","\n","Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. â¦ As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .\n","\n","The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressinggowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harryâs eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought\n","\n","Dumbledoreâs body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\n","\n","âWhatâre they all lookinâ at?â said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. âWhaâs that lyinâ on the grass?â Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. âSee it, Harry? Right at the foot of the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh donâ think someone got thrown - ?â\n","\n","Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .\n","\n","He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.\n","\n","Harry heard Hagridâs moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full BodyBind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spreadeagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.\n","\n","Dumbledoreâs eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the halfmoon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he helpââ\n","\n","The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.\n","\n","The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledoreâs pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrongââ\n","\n","He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.\n","\n","Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:\n","\n","To the Dark Lord\n","\n","I now I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who dicovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\n","\n","I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more.\n","\n","R.A.B.\n","\n","Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 29: The Pheonix Lament\n","\n","\n","C âmere, Harry â¦â\n","\n","âNo.â\n","\n","âYeh canâ stay here, Harry. â¦ Come on, nowâ¦.â âNo.â\n","\n","He did not want to leave Dumbledores side, he did not want to move anywhere. Hagridâs hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, âHarry, come on.â\n","\n","A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harryâs vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.\n","\n","âWeâre going to the hospital wing,â said Ginny.\n","\n","âIâm not hurt,â said Harry. !\n","\n","âItâs McGonagalls orders,â said Ginny. âEveryoneâs up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone -â\n","\n","Fear stirred in Harryâs chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.\n","\n","âGinny, who else is dead?â\n","\n","âDonât worry, none of us.â\n","\n","âBut the Dark Mark - Malfoy said he stepped over a body -â\n","\n","âHe stepped over Bill, but its all right, heâs alive.â\n","\n","There was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.\n","\n","âAre you sure?â\n","\n","âOf course Iâm sure . . . heâs a - a bit of a mess, thatâs all. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he wonât - wonât look the same anymore. . . .â\n","\n","Ginnyâs voice trembled a little.\n","\n","âWe donât really know what the aftereffects will be - I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.â\n","\n","âBut the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . .â\n","\n","âNeville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says theyâll be all right. And a Death Eaterâs dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere - Harry, if we hadnât had your Felix potion, I think weâd all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us -â\n","\n","They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.\n","\n","âAre you all right, Harry?â\n","\n","âIâm fineâ¦. Howâs Bill?â\n","\n","Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermioneâs shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Billâs pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harshsmelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoyâs Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.\n","\n","âCanât you fix them with a charm or something?â he asked the matron.\n","\n","âNo charm will work on these,â said Madam Pomfrey. âIâve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites.â\n","\n","âBut he wasnât bitten at the full moon,â said Ron, who was gazing down into his brotherâs face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. âGreyback hadnât transformed, so surely Bill wonât be a - a real - ?â :\n","\n","He looked uncertainly at Lupin.\n","\n","âNo, I donât think that Bill will be a true werewolf,â said Lupin, âbut that does not mean that there wonât be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and - and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.â\n","\n","âDumbledore might know something thatâd work, though,â Ron said. âWhere is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledoreâs orders, Dumbledore owes him, he canât leave him in this state -â\n","\n","âRon - Dumbledores dead,â said Ginny.\n","\n","âNo!â Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did nor, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Billâs bed, his hands over his face. Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ronâs eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.\n","\n","âHow did he die?â whispered Tonks. âHow did it happen?â\n","\n","âSnape killed him,â said Harry. âI was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because thatâs where the Mark was. . . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldnât do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak - and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him -â\n","\n","Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Lunaâs mouth trembled.\n","\n","â- more Death Eaters arrived - and then Snape - and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.â Harry couldnât go on.\n","\n","Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered, âShh! Listen!â\n","\n","Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.\n","\n","How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.\n","\n","âMolly and Arthur are on their way,â she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads. âHarry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he - when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some -â âSnape killed Dumbledore,â said Harry.\n","\n","She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.\n","\n","âSnape,â repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. âWe all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snapeâ¦ I canât believe it. â¦â\n","\n","âSnape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,â said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. âWe always knew that.â\n","\n","âBut Dumbledore swore he was on our side!â whispered Tonks. âI always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didnât. â¦â .\n","\n","âHe always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,â muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartanedged handkerchief. âI mean . . . with Snapes history â¦ of course people were bound to wonder. . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snapeâs repentance was absolutely genuineââWouldnât hear a word against him!â\n","\n","âIâd love to know what Snape told him to convince him,â said Tonks.\n","\n","âI know,â said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. âSnape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadnât realized what he was doing, he was really sorry heâd done it, sorry that they were dead.â\n","\n","They all stared at him.\n","\n","âAnd Dumbledore believed that?â said Lupin incredulously. âDumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . .â\n","\n","âAnd he didnât think my mother was worth a damn either,â said Harry, âbecause she was Mugglebornâ¦ âMudblood,â he called her. â¦â\n","\n","Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.\n","\n","âThis is all my fault,â said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. âMy fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadnât alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I donât think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I donât think he knew they were coming.â\n","\n","âIt isnât your fault, Minerva,â said Lupin firmly. âWe all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his wayâ¦.â\n","\n","âSo when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eatersâ side?â asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snapeâs duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.\n","\n","âI donât know exactly how it happened,â said Professor McGonagall distractedly. âItâs all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us â¦ and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still donât know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .â\n","\n","âI do,â said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. âSo they got in through the Room of Requirement.â\n","\n","Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.\n","\n","âI messed up, Harry,â said Ron bleakly. âWe did like you told us: We checked the Marauderâs Map and we couldnât see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on itâ¦ but Malfoy got past us.â\n","\n","âHe came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,â said Ginny. âHe was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -â\n","\n","âHis Hand of Glory,â said Ron. âGives light only to the holder, remember?â\n","\n","âAnyway,â Ginny went on, âhe must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitchblack -â\n","\n","â- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,â said Ron bitterly. âFred and Georgeâs. Iâm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.â\n","\n","âWe tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,â said Ginny. âNothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didnât dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time weâd reached a corridor that was light, theyâd gone.â\n","\n","âLuckily,â said Lupin hoarsely, âRon, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadnât expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -â\n","\n","âTo set off the Mark?â asked Harry.\n","\n","âHe must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,â said Lupin. âBut I donât think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.â\n","\n","âSo if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,â said Harry, turning to Hermione, âwere you - ?â\n","\n","âOutside Snapeâs office, yes,â whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, âwith Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didnât know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the mapââIt was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I donât think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snapeâs office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -â âWhat?â Harry urged her.\n","\n","âI was so stupid, Harry!â said Hermione in a highpitched whisper. âHe said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -â She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. âWe went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, itâs so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didnât realize, Harry, we didnât realize, we just let Snape go!â\n","\n","âItâs not your fault,â said Lupin firmly. âHermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna.â\n","\n","âSo then he came upstairs,â said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mindâs eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, âand he found the place where you were all fighting. â¦â\n","\n","âWe were in trouble, we were losing,â said Tonks in a low voice. âGibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greybackâ¦ It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -â\n","\n","âNone of us could break through,â said Ron, âand that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . .â\n","\n","âAnd then Snape was there,â said Tonks, âand then he wasnât -â\n","\n","âI saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,â said Ginny.\n","\n","âI saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasnât there,â said Lupin. âI tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville. . . .â\n","\n","âHe must have known a spell we didnât,â whispered McGonagall. âAfter all - he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. â¦ I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters whoâd escaped up to the tower. â¦â\n","\n","âHe was,â said Harry savagely, âbut to help them, not to stop them . . . and Iâll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier - so what happened when he came back down?â\n","\n","âWell, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,â said Lupin. âWe all ran forward - those of us who were still standing anyway - and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust - obviously, none of us attacked them -â\n","\n","âWe just let them pass,â said Tonks in a hollow voice. âWe thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters - and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again - I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I donât know what -â\n","\n","âHe shouted, âItâs over,ââ said Harry. âHeâd done what heâd meant to do.â\n","\n","They all fell silent. Fawkesâs lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harryâs mind. . . . Had they taken Dumbledoreâs body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.\n","\n","The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.\n","\n","âMolly - Arthur -â said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. âI am so sorry -â\n","\n","âBill,â whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Billâs mangled face. âOh, Bill!â\n","\n","Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.\n","\n","âYou said Greyback attacked him?â Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. âBut he hadnât transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?â\n","\n","âWe donât yet know,â said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.\n","\n","âThere will probably be some contamination, Arthur,â .said Lupin. âIt is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We donât know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . .â\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley took the nastysmelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Billâs wounds.\n","\n","âAnd Dumbledore â¦â said Mr. Weasley. âMinerva, is it true â¦ Is he really. . . ?â\n","\n","As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.\n","\n","âDumbledore gone,â whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Billâs mutilated face.\n","\n","âOf course, it doesnât matter how he looks. . . . Itâs not rreally important. . . but he was a very handsome little bboy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was ggoing to be married!â\n","\n","âAnd what do you mean by zat?â said Fleur suddenly and loudly. âWhat do you mean, â he was going to be married?ââ\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley raised her tearstained face, looking startled. âWell -only that-â\n","\n","âYou theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?â demanded Fleur. âYou theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?â\n","\n","âNo, thatâs not what I -â\n","\n","âBecause âe will!â said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. âIt would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!â\n","\n","âWell, yes, Iâm sure,â said Mrs. Weasley, âbut I thought perhaps - given how - how he -â\n","\n","âYou thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or perâaps, you hoped?â said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. âWhat do I care how he looks? I am goodlooking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!â she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.\n","\n","Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Billâs wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.\n","\n","âOur GreatAuntie Muriel,â said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, âhas a very beautiful tiara - goblinmade - which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.â\n","\n","âThank you,â said Fleur stiffly. âI am sure zat will be lovely.â\n","\n","And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both , women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.\n","\n","âYou see!â said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. âShe still wants to marry him, even though heâs been bitten! She doesnât care!\n","\n","âItâs different,â said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. âBill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely -â\n","\n","âBut I donât care either, I donât care!â said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupinâs robes and shaking them. âIâve told you a million times. . . .â\n","\n","And the meaning of Tonksâs Patronus and her mousecolored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sinus that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.\n","\n","âAnd Iâve told you a million times,â said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, âthat I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . .â\n","\n","âIâve said all along youâre taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,â said Mrs. Weasley over Fleurâs shoulder as she patted her on the back.\n","\n","âI am not being ridiculous,â said Lupin steadily. âTonks deserves somebody young and whole.â\n","\n","âBut she wants you,â said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. âAnd after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.â\n","\n","He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.\n","\n","âThis isâ¦ not the moment to discuss it,â said Lupin, avoiding everybodyâs eyes as he looked around distractedly. âDumbledore is dead. â¦â\n","\n","âDumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,â said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.\n","\n","The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand.\n","\n","âIâve . . . Iâve done it, Professor,â he choked. âMmoved him. Professor Sproutâs got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwickâs lyin down, but he says heâll be all righâ in a jiffy, anâ Professor Slughorn says the Ministryâs bin informed.â\n","\n","âThank you, Hagrid,â said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Billâs bed. âI shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses - Slughorn can represent Slytherin - that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too.â\n","\n","As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry. âBefore I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If youâll come with me. â¦â\n","\n","Harry stood up, murmured âSee you in a bitâ to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagallâs office, but for Dumbledoreâs, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress, . . . Apparently she was now headmistress â¦ so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.\n","\n","In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledoreâs body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables, Gryffindorâs sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Fawkesâs perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his halfmoon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.\n","\n","After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded theâ desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.\n","\n","âHarry,â she said, âI would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.â\n","\n","âI canât tell you that, Professor,â said Harry. He had expected the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.\n","\n","âHarry, it might be important,â said Professor McGonagall.\n","\n","âIt is,â said Harry, âvery, but he didnât want me to tell anyone.â\n","\n","Professor McGonagall glared at him. âPotterâ - Harry registered the renewed use of his surname - âin the light of Professor Dumbledoreâs death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat -â\n","\n","âI donât think so,â said Harry, shrugging. âProfessor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.â But -\n","\n","âThereâs one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmertaâs under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, thatâs how the necklace and the poisoned mead -â\n","\n","âRosmerta?â said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.\n","\n","âSnape!â ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. âSnape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!â\n","\n","But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallowfaced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas. âMinerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry.â\n","\n","âThank you, Everard,â said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly to her teachers.\n","\n","âI want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,â she said quickly. âPersonally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwartsâs history. It is horrible.â\n","\n","âI am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,â said Professor Sprout. âI feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.â\n","\n","âBut will we have a single pupil after this?â said Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. âParents will want to keep their children at home and I canât say I blame them. Personally, I donât think weâre in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you canât expect mothers to think like that. Theyâll want to keep their families together, itâs only natural.â\n","\n","âI agree,â said Professor McGonagall. âAnd in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school - and I must say that Professor Dumbledoreâs murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherinâs monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . .â\n","\n","âWe must consult the governors,â said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snapeâs office. âWe must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.â\n","\n","âHagrid, you havenât said anything,â said Professor McGonagall. âWhat are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?â\n","\n","Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, âI dunno, Professor . . . thatâs fer the Heads of House an the headmistress ter decide â¦â\n","\n","âProfessor Dumbledore always valued your views,â said Professor McGonagall kindly, âand so do I.â\n","\n","âWell, Iâm stayin,â said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. âItâs me home, itâs bin me home since I was thirteen. Anâ if thereâs kids who wanâ me ter teach âem, Iâll do it. Butâ¦ I dunno â¦ Hogwarts without Dumbledore .. .â He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.\n","\n","âVery well,â said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, âthen I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.\n","\n","âNow, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary -â\n","\n","âWhat about Dumbledoreâs funeral?â said Harry, speaking at last.\n","\n","âWell. . .â said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. âI - I know that it was Dumbledoreâs wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts -â\n","\n","âThen thatâs whatâll happen, isnât it?â said Harry fiercely.\n","\n","âIf the Ministry thinks it appropriate,â said Professor McGonagall. âNo other headmaster or headmistress has ever been -â\n","\n","âNo other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,â growled Hagrid.\n","\n","âHogwarts should be Dumbledoreâs final resting place,â said Professor Flitwick.\n","\n","âAbsolutely,â said Professor Sprout.\n","\n","âAnd in that case,â said Harry, âyou shouldnât send the students home until the jfuneralâs over. Theyâll want to say -â\n","\n","The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him. âGoodbye.â\n","\n","âWell said,â squeaked Professor Flitwick. âWell said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterward.â\n","\n","âSeconded,â barked Professor Sprout. ]\n","\n","âI suppose â¦ yes .. .â said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.\n","\n","âHeâs coming,â said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. âThe Minister . . . and by the looks of it. heâs brought a delegation . . .â\n","\n","âCan I leave, Professor?â said Harry at once.\n","\n","He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.\n","\n","âYou may,â said Professor McGonagall. âAnd quickly.â\n","\n","She strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; hehad left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.\n","\n","âIs it true?â whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. âIt is really true? Dumbledore - dead?â\n","\n","âYes,â said Harry.\n","\n","She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.\n","\n","As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jampacked. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boysâ dormitories.\n","\n","As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own fourposter and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.\n","\n","âTheyâre talking about closing the school,â said Harry.\n","\n","âLupin said they would,â said Ron.\n","\n","There was a pause.\n","\n","âSo?â said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. âDid you find one? Did you get it? A - a Horcrux?â\n","\n","Harry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?\n","\n","âYou didnât get it?â said Ron, looking crestfallen. âIt wasnât there?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry. âSomeone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.â\n","\n","âAlready taken - ?â\n","\n","Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. â¦ It did not matter tonight. . . nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledoreâs life. . . .\n","\n","âR.A.B.,â whispered Ron, âbut who was that?â\n","\n","âDunno,â said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing. And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that ilie phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Chapter 30: The White Tomb\n","\n","\n","All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days - the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledoreâs death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughtylooking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused pointblank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Durnbledore.\n","\n","Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powderblue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome oliveskinned, blackhaired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagridâs arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he\n","\n","was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledoreâs last excursion from Hogwarts.\n","\n","Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Durnbledore had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginnyâs examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted â¦ and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.\n","\n","They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfreyâs care. His scars were as bad as ever; in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to MadEye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs, but in personality he seemed jusi the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.\n","\n","ââ¦ so eet ees lucky âe is marrying me,â said Fleur happily, plumping up Billâs pillows, âbecause ze British overcook their meat, I âave always said this.â\n","\n","âI suppose Iâm just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,â sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds,\n","\n","âSheâs not that bad,â said Harry. âUgly, though,â he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.\n","\n","âWell, I suppose if Mum can stand it, 1 can.â\n","\n","âAnyone else we know died?â Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.\n","\n","Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice.\n","\n","âNo,â she said reprovingly, folding up ihe newspaper. âTheyâre still looking for Snape, but no sign â¦â\n","\n","âOf course there isnât,â said Harry, who became angry every lime this subject cropped up. They wonât find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as theyâve never managed to do that in all this time â¦â\n","\n","âIâm going to go to bed,â yawned Ginny. âI havenât been sleeping thai well since â¦ well â¦ I could do with some sleep.â\n","\n","She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved al the other two and departed for the girlsâ dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forwards towards Harry with a most Hermioneish look on her face.\n","\n","âHarry, I found something ou( this morning, in the library ..,â\n","\n","âR.A.B.?â said Harry, silling up straight.\n","\n","He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: âthe locket .., the cup â¦ the snake â¦ something of Gryffindorâs or Ravenclawâs â¦ the locket â¦ the cup â¦ the snake â¦ something of Gryffindorâs or Ravenclawâs â¦â\n","\n","This mantra seemed to pulse through Harryâs mind as he\n","\n","fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb â¦\n","\n","He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledoreâs death, and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.\n","\n","âNo,â she said sadly, âIâve been trying, Harry, but I havenât found anything â¦ there are a couple of reasonably wellknown wizards with those initials - Rosalind Antigone Bungs â¦ Rupert âAxebangerâ Brookstanton â¦ but they donât seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I canât find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him â¦ no, actually, itâs about â¦ well, Snape.â\n","\n","She looked nervous even saying the name again.\n","\n","âWhat about him?â asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.\n","\n","âWell, itâs just that I was sort of right about the HalfBlood Prince business,â she said tentatively.\n","\n","âDâyou have to rub it in, Hermione? How tTyou think 1 feel about that now?â\n","\n","âNo - no - Harry, I didnât mean that!â she said hastily, looking around to check that they were not being overheard. âItâs just that 1 was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see â¦ she was Snapeâs mother!â\n","\n","T thought she wasnât much of a looker,â said Ron. Hermione ignored him.\n","\n","â1 was going through ihe rest of the old Prophets and there\n","\n","was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that sheâd given birth to a -â\n","\n","â- murderer,â spat Harry.\n","\n","âWell â¦ yes,â said Hermione. âSo â¦ 1 was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being âhalf a Princeâ, you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggie from what it said in the Prophetâ\n","\n","âYeah, that fits,â said Harry. âHeâd play up the pureblood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them â¦ heâs just like Voldemort. Pureblood mother, Muggie father â¦ ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name - Lard Voldemort - the HalfBlood Prince - how could Dumbledore have missed -?â\n","\n","He broke off, looking out of the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledoreâs inexcusable trust in Snape â¦ but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same â¦ in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much â¦\n","\n","Helped him â¦ it was an almost unendurable thought, now â¦\n","\n","âI still donât get why he didnât turn you in for using that book,â said Ron. âHe mustâve known where you were getting it ali from.â\n","\n","âHe knew,â said Harry bitterly. âHe knew when I used Secfumsempra. He didnât really need Legilimency â¦ he might even have known before then, with Slughom talking about how brilliant I was at Potions â¦ shouldnât have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?â\n","\n","âBut why didnât he turn you in?â\n","\n","âI donât ihink he wanted to associate himself with that book,â said Hermione. âI donât think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if heâd known. And even if Snape pretended it hadnât been his, Slughom would have recognised his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snapeâs old classroom, and Iâll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called âPrinceâ.â\n","\n","T shouldâve shown the book to Dumbledore,â said Harry. âAll that lime he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and 1 had proof Snape was, too -â\n","\n","ââEvilâ is a strong word,â said Hermione quietly.\n","\n","âYou were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!â\n","\n","âIâm trying to say, Harry, that youâre pulling too much blame on yourself. 1 thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer â¦â\n","\n","âNone of us couldâve guessed Snape would â¦ you know,â said Ron.\n","\n","Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledoreâs body would be laid to rest. Harry had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledoreâs death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult 10 believe that Dumbledore\n","\n","had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back â¦ he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.\n","\n","Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Downstairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagridâs chair was deserted too: Harry thought thai perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast; but Snapeâs place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeourâs entourage Harry spotted the red hair and hornrimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.\n","\n","Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were mutter\n","\n","ing together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked\n","\n","oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between\n","\n","them, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy\n","\n","much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had\n","\n","not forgotten the fear in Malfoyâs voice on that Tower top, nor\n","\n","the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death\n","\n","Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have\n","\n","killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatu\n","\n","ation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity\n","\n","mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy\n","\n","now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of\n","\n","killing him and his parents? ? â¢â¢â¢>.\n","\n","Harryâs thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.\n","\n","âIt is nearly time,â she said. âPlease follow your Heads of House out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.â\n","\n","They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emeraldgreen robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the Entrance Hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothbails.\n","\n","They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors, towards the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summerâs day.\n","\n","An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, MadEye Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up twoandahalf chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harryâs Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the\n","\n","wizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hogâs Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air.\n","\n","Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermioneâs summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most â¦ probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting â¦\n","\n","Cornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her redtakmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her ironcoloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the waterâs edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.\n","\n","The staff were seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore wasand he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.\n","\n","âIn there,â whispered Ginny in Harryâs ear.\n","\n","And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harryâs neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledoreâs passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round.\n","\n","Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledoreâs body. A sharp pain rose in Harryâs throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledoreâs body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermioneâs laps.\n","\n","They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge â¦ but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagridâs eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid\n","\n","was heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his halfbrother and Grawp palled Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again.\n","\n","A little tuftyhaired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledoreâs body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads. âNobility of spiritâ â¦ âintellectual contributionâ â¦ âgreatness of heartâ â¦ it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledoreâs idea of a few words: ânitwitâ, âoddmentâ, âblubberâ and âtweak 1, and again, had to suppress a grin â¦ what was the matter with him?\n","\n","There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the waterâs edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said â¦\n","\n","And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone â¦ he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on â¦ there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them\n","\n","standing quite still, halfhidden in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated â¦\n","\n","And Harry saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parentâs arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before.\n","\n","The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.\n","\n","Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledoreâs body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heartstopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledoreâs body and the table on which he had rested.\n","\n","There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaursâ tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.\n","\n","Harry looked ai Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ronâs face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Hermioneâs face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harryâs gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say âBe carefulâ, or âDonât do itâ, but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died.\n","\n","âGinny, listen â¦â he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet. âI canât be involved with you any more. Weâve got to stop seeing each other. We canât be together.â\n","\n","She said, with an oddly twisted smile, âItâs for some stupid, noble reason, isnât it?â\n","\n","âItâs been like â¦ like something out of someone elseâs life, these last few weeks with you,â said Harry. âBut 1 canât â¦ we canât â¦ Iâve got things to do alone now.â\n","\n","She did not cry, she simply looked at him,\n","\n","âVoldemort uses people his enemies are close to. Heâs already used you as bait once, and that was just because youâre my best friendâs sister. Think how much danger youâll be in if we keep this up. Heâll know, heâll find out. Heâll try and get to me through you.â\n","\n","âWhat if I donât care?â said Ginny fiercely.\n","\n","âI care,â said Harry. âHow do you think Iâd feel if this was your funeral â¦ and it was my fault â¦â\n","\n","She looked away from him, over the lake.\n","\n","T never really gave up on you,â she said. âNot really. I always hoped â¦ Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.â\n","\n","âSmart girl, that Hermione,â said Harry, trying to smile. âI just wish Iâd asked you sooner. We coukTve had ages â¦ months â¦ years maybe â¦â\n","\n","âBut youâve been too busy saving the wizarding world,â said Ginny, halflaughing. âWell â¦ I canât say Iâm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldnât be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe thatâs why I like you so much.â\n","\n","Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledoreâs tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it â¦\n","\n","âHarry!â\n","\n","He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick.\n","\n","âIâve been hoping to have a word â¦ do you mind if I walk a little way with you?â\n","\n","âNo,â said Harry indifferently, and set off again.\n","\n","âHarry, this was a dreadful tragedy,â said Scrimgeour quietly, âI cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows better than 1 -â\n","\n","â¢What do you want?â asked Harry flatly.\n","\n","Scrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding.\n","\n","âYou are, of course, devastated,â he said. âI know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you -â\n","\n","âWhat do you want?â Harry repeated, coming to a halt.\n","\n","Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.\n","\n","âThe word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.â\n","\n","âWhose word?â said Harry.\n","\n","âSomebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.â\n","\n","âGlad to hear it,â said Harry. âWell, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He didnât want people to know.â\n","\n","âSuch loyalty is admirable, of course,â said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, âbul Dumbledore is gone, Harry. Heâs gone.â\n","\n","âHe will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,â said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.\n","\n","âMy dear boy â¦ even Dumbledore cannot return from the-â\n","\n","âI am not saying he can. You wouldnât understand. But Iâve got nothing to tell you.â\n","\n","Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently\n","\n","supposed to be a tone of delicacy, The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service -â\n","\n","Harry laughed.\n","\n","âVoldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors wonât stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.â\n","\n","âSo,â said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, âthe request 1 made of you at Christmas -â\n","\n","âWhat request? Oh yeah â¦ the one where I tell the world what a great job youâre doing in exchange for ââ\n","\n","â- for raising everyoneâs morale!â snapped Scrimgeour.\n","\n","Harry considered him for a moment.\n","\n","âReleased Stan Shunpike yet?â\n","\n","Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon.\n","\n","â1 see you are -â\n","\n","âDumbledoreâs man through and through,â said Harry. âThatâs right.â\n","\n","Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying towards Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction; Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times.\n","\n","âWhat did Scrimgeour want?â Hermione whispered.\n","\n","âSame as he wanted at Christmas,â shrugged Harry. âWanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministryâs new poster boy.â\n","\n","Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, âLook, let me go back and hit Percy!â\n","\n","âNo,â she said firmly, grabbing his arm.\n","\n","âItâll make me feel better!â\n","\n","Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle.\n","\n","âI canât bear the idea that we might never come back.â she said softly. âHow can Hogwarts close?â\n","\n","âMaybe it wonât,â said Ron. âWeâre not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhereâs the same now. Iâd even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What dâyou reckon, Harry?â\n","\n","âIâm not coming back even if it does reopen,â said Harry.\n","\n","Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, âI knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do? 1\n","\n","âIâm going back to the Dursleysâ once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,â said Harry. âBut itâll be a short visit, and then Iâll be gone for good.â\n","\n","âBut where will you go if you donât come back to school?â\n","\n","âI thought I might go back to Godricâs Hollow,â Harry muttered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledoreâs death. âFor me, it started there, all of it. Iâve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parentsâ graves, Iâd like that.â\n","\n","âAnd then what?â said Ron.\n","\n","Then Iâve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, havenât I?â said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledoreâs white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. Thatâs what he wanted me to do, thatâs why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right - and Iâm sure he was -there are still four of them out there. Iâve got to find them and destroy them and then Iâve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemortâs soul, the bit thatâs still in his body, and Iâm the one whoâs going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape\n","\n","along the way,â he added, âso much trie better tor me, so mucn the worse for him.â\n","\n","There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water.\n","\n","âWeâll be there, Harry,â said Ron.\n","\n","âWhat?â\n","\n","At your aunt and uncleâs house,â said Ron. âAnd then weâll go with you, wherever youâre going.â\n","\n","âNo -â said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.\n","\n","âYou said to us once before,â said Hermione quietly, âthat there was time to turn back if we wanted to. Weâve had time, havenât we?â\n","\n","âWeâre with you whatever happens,â said Ron. âBut, mate, youâre going to have to come round my mum and dadâs house before we do anything else, even Godricâs Hollow.â\n","\n","âWhy?â\n","\n","âBill and Fleurâs wedding, remember?â\n","\n","Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.\n","\n","âYeah, we shouldnât miss that,â he said finally.\n","\n","His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["nltk.download('punkt_tab')\n","import nltk\n","from

window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass.',\n"," 'It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.',\n"," 'He froze,

into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece.',\n"," 'He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top.',\n"," 'Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pinstriped cloak, a limegreen bowler hat in his hand.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cAhâ\\x80¦ Prime Minister,â\\x80\\x9d said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cGood to see you again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all.',\n"," 'He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news.',\n"," 'Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn.',\n"," 'He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look.',\n"," 'The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cHow can I help you?â\\x80\\x9d he said, shaking Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cDifficult to know where to begin,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWhat a week, what a weekâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad a bad one too, have you?â\\x80\\x9d asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cYes, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been having the same week you have, Prime Minister.',\n"," 'The Brockdale Bridgeâ\\x80¦ the Bones and Vance murdersâ\\x80¦ not to mention the ruckus in the West

was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy.',\n"," 'But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister.',\n"," 'He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.',\n"," 'He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself\\n\\nNaturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad.',\n"," 'He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfproclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand.',\n"," 'He had remained speechless throughout Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical population from getting wind of them.',\n"," 'It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point).',\n"," 'Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the stilldumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cNot to worry,â\\x80\\x9d he had said, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s oddson youâ\\x80\\x99ll never see me again.',\n"," 'Iâ\\x80\\x99ll only bother you if thereâ\\x80\\x99s something really serious going on our end, something thatâ\\x80\\x99s likely to affect the Mugglesâ\\x80\\x93the nonmagical population, I should say.',\n"," 'Otherwise, itâ\\x80\\x99s live and let live.',\n"," 'And I must say, youâ\\x80\\x99re taking it a lot better than your predecessor.',\n"," 'He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99reâ\\x80\\x93youâ\\x80\\x99re not a hoax, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt had been his last, desperate hope.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge gently.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Iâ\\x80\\x99m not.',\n"," 'Look.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he had turned the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s teacup into a gerbil.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, â\\x80\\x9cbut whyâ\\x80\\x93why has nobody told meâ\\x80\\x93?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Minister of Magic only reveals himâ\\x80\\x93or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,â\\x80\\x9d said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWe find it the best way to maintain secrecy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut then,â\\x80\\x9d bleated the Prime Minister, â\\x80\\x9cwhy hasnâ\\x80\\x99t a former Prime Minister warned meâ\\x80\\x93?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this, Fudge had actually laughed.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStill chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound.',\n"," 'The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?',\n"," 'The shock had taken a little while to wear off.',\n"," 'For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign.',\n"," 'In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s arrival.',\n"," 'To the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove.',\n"," 'When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to pry it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office.',\n"," 'Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind.',\n"," 'However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.',\n"," 'Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic.',\n"," 'Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named â\\x80\\x9cSeriousâ\\x80\\x9d Black, something that sounded like â\\x80\\x9cHogwarts,â\\x80\\x9d and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just come from Azkaban,â\\x80\\x9d Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cMiddle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flightâ\\x80¦ the dementors are in uproarâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x93he shudderedâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a breakout before.',\n"," 'Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister.',\n"," 'Blackâ\\x80\\x99s a known

then said, â\\x80\\x9cWell, sit down, sit down, Iâ\\x80\\x99d better fill you inâ\\x80¦ Have a whiskeyâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless.',\n"," 'Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and drew up a chair.',\n"," 'Fudge had talked for more than an hour.',\n"," 'At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s whiskeyfree hand.',\n"," 'When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cSo you think thatâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d He had squinted down at the name in his left hand.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cLord Volâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeWhoMustNotBeNamed!â\\x80\\x9d snarled Fudge.',\n","

to be worrying about.',\n"," 'Youâ\\x80\\x99ll put out that warning, then?',\n"," 'Excellent.',\n"," 'Well, I hope we donâ\\x80\\x99t see each other again, Prime Minister!',\n"," 'Good night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut they had seen each other again.',\n"," 'Less than a year later a harassedlooking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been â\\x80\\x9cinvolved,â\\x80\\x9d but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that YouKnowWhoâ\\x80\\x99s Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cOh, and I almost forgot,â\\x80\\x9d Fudge had added.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that itâ\\x80\\x99s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if weâ\\x80\\x99re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x93whatâ\\x80\\x93dragons?â\\x80\\x9d spluttered the Prime Minister.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cYes, three,â\\x80\\x9d

'Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cA mass breakout?â\\x80\\x9d repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cNo need to worry, no need to worry!â\\x80\\x9d shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll have them

shower of green sparks.',\n"," 'Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man.',\n"," 'It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudgeâ\\x80\\x99s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit.',\n"," 'Little though he liked to think about the

persistent glass of mead, â\\x80\\x9cBlack family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of â\\x80\\x98Black.â\\x80\\x99 Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless.',\n"," 'While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless

could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, â\\x80\\x9cWill you get these ruddy things off us?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their

evening, Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, straightening up again.',\n"," 'Harrys jaw dropped.',\n"," 'Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat,

away?â\\x80\\x9d he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly.',\n"," 'He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, looking amused, â\\x80\\x9cif the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the

the ends of his mustache flutter.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWould you like my assistance clearing up?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore politely.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cPlease,â\\x80\\x9d said the other.',\n"," 'They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.',\n"," 'The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments relormed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; avast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of blood was that, incidentally?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather flock.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cOn the walls?',\n"," 'Dragon,â\\x80\\x9d shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.',\n"," 'There was a final plunk from the piano,

dusty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed.',\n"," 'It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cOho,â\\x80\\x9d he said, his large round eyes flying to

thatâ\\x80\\x99s how you thought youâ\\x80\\x99d persuade me, is it?',\n"," 'Well, the answerâ\\x80\\x99s no, Albus.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cI suppose we can have a drink, at least?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cFor old timeâ\\x80\\x99s

the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp.',\n"," 'Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible.',\n"," 'Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cHmpf,â\\x80\\x9d he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cHere â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence.',\n"," 'His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWell, how have you been keeping, Horace?â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore asked.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cNot so well,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn at once.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWeak

canâ\\x80\\x99t have had more than three minutesâ\\x80\\x99 warning?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, â\\x80\\x9cTwo.',\n"," 'Didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath.',\n"," 'Still,â\\x80\\x9d he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, â\\x80\\x9cthe fact remains that Iâ\\x80\\x99m an old man, Albus.',\n"," 'A tired old man whoâ\\x80\\x99s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room.',\n"," 'It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions.',\n"," 'If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re not yet as old as I am, Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWell, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn bluntly.',\n"," 'His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledoreâ\\x80\\x99s injured hand.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cReactions not what they were, I see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re quite right,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened ringers; the sight of them made the back of Harryâ\\x80\\x99s neck prickle unpleasantly.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9c1 am undoubtedly slower than I was.',\n"," 'But on the other handâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle.',\n"," 'Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cSo, all these precautions against intruders, Horaceâ\\x80¦ are they for the Death Eatersâ\\x80\\x99 benefit, or mine?â\\x80\\x9d asked Dumbledore.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWhat would the Death Eaters want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Slughorn.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cI imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cAre you really telling me that they havenâ\\x80\\x99t come recruiting yet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSlughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, â\\x80\\x9cI havenâ\\x80\\x99t given them the chance.',\n"," 'Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been on the move for a year.',\n"," 'Never stay in one place more than a week.',\n"," 'Move from Muggle house to Muggle house â\\x80\\x94 the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s been very pleasant, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be sorry to leave.',\n"," 'Itâ\\x80\\x99s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors donâ\\x80\\x99t spot you bringing in the piano.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIngenious,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cBut it sounds a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life.',\n"," 'Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can

voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cMost of the teachers arenâ\\x80\\x99t in it, and none of them has ever been killed â\\x80\\x94 well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemortâ\\x80\\x99s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest,

that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered grudgingly.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cAnd I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters, HeWhoMustNotBeNamed can hardly count me a friendâ\\x80¦ in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albusâ\\x80¦ I cannot pretend that Amelia Bonesâ\\x80\\x99s death did not shake meâ\\x80¦ If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protectionâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.',\n","

is time for us to leave.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNot at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet.',\n"," 'Slughorn sinned taken aback.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re

twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry you donâ\\x80\\x99t want the job, Horace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cHogwarts would have been glad to see you back again.',\n"," 'Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80¦ wellâ\\x80¦ very graciousâ\\x80¦ as I sayâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodbye, then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBye,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry.',\n"," 'They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cAll right, all right, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cYou will come out of retirement?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Slughorn impatiently.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cI must be mad, but yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWonderful,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, beaming.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cThen, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I daresay you will,â\\x80\\x9d grunted Slughorn.',\n"," 'As they set off down the garden path, Slughornâ\\x80\\x99s voice floated after them, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore chuckled.',\n"," 'The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cWell done, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry in surprise.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cOh yes you did.',\n"," 'You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts.',\n"," 'Did you like him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cErâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not.',\n"," 'He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggleborn should make a good witch.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cHorace,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, â\\x80\\x9clikes his comfort.',\n"," 'He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful.',\n"," 'He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people.',\n"," 'He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat â\\x80\\x94 more room to spread out, you see.',\n"," 'He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields.',\n"," 'Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystallized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cI tell you all this,â\\x80\\x9d Dumbledore continued, â\\x80\\x9cnot to turn you against Horace â\\x80\\x94 or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn â\\x80\\x94 but to put you on your guard.',\n"," 'He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry.',\n"," 'You would be the jewel of his collection; â\\x80\\x98the Boy Who Livedâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80¦ or, as they call you these days, â\\x80\\x98the Chosen One.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry.',\n"," 'He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survivesâ\\x80¦\\n\\nDumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cThis will do, Harry.',\n"," 'If you will grasp my arm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBraced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant.',\n"," 'When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow.',\n"," 'In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it.',\n"," 'Ron was in thereâ\\x80¦ and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knewâ\\x80¦\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like a few words with you before we part.',\n"," 'In private.',\n"," 'Perhaps in here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks.',\n"," 'A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard.',\n"," 'Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.',\n"," 'â\\x80\\x9cI hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry.',\n"," 'Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHarry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him.',\n"," 'He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say â\\x80\\x9cHis godfatherâ\\x80\\x99s dead?â\\x80\\x9d and even worse to hear Siriuss name thrown out casually by Slughorn.',\n","
